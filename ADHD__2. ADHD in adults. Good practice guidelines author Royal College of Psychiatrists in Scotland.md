The aims of this publication are to: 

 z provide psychiatrists with practical, evidence-based guidance in managing adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in mental healthcare settings z provide those involved in designing mental healthcare services in Scotland with a consensus view on how best to meet the needs of adults with ADHD. 

This guidance draws on evidence summarised in established documents, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline CG72 (NICE, 2008), the British Association of Psychopharmacology’s guidelines (Bolea-Alamañac _et al_ , 2014) and the European Consensus Statement (Kooij _et al_ , 2010). 

This is a compact reference guide for those working with this patient group. It is not a substitute for the more extensive guidelines referred to above or for formal clinical training. 

Where there is insufficient trial-based evidence, our guidance draws from the clinical experience of the psychiatrists of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland Adult ADHD Working Group. 

This guidance has been developed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland to assist psychiatrists and those designing services in Scotland with providing evidence-based care for adults with ADHD. It is thus written to be applicable to the Scottish health system. However, the evidence, principles and approaches it sets out may also be relevant for other jurisdictions of the UK. 

## Aims and structure

## Background 

Commitment 33 of the Mental Health Strategy for Scotland 2012–2015 (Scottish Government, 2012) undertakes to develop specialist capability with respect to those with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including ADHD, in adults. Scottish health boards therefore need to address this emergent clinical and educational need. 

The evidence base for treatment of adult ADHD is evolving. 

 z There is strong evidence that ADHD-related impairments persist into adulthood. z Two-thirds of children diagnosed with ADHD continue to have the full syndrome or are in partial remission beyond the age of 18 (Faraone et al , 2006). z NICE benchmarking suggests that 25 individuals per 100^000 population per year will transition into adult services. z Between 2.5 and 4% of British adults may benefit from treatment (Faraone & Biederman, 2005). z ADHD is a highly heritable condition (Faraone^ et al , 2000). 

Despite this evidence, levels of adult diagnosis and treatment in Scotland are well below expected. In 2009–2010, 773 individuals aged 20–64 were prescribed medications for ADHD, representing 0.02% of the age group. This rose to 1800 individuals (0.06%) in 2013–2014 (ISD Scotland, 2014). These numbers fall significantly short of the anticipated 2.5–4%. In those younger than 20 years of age, 0.5% in 2009–2010 and 0.6% in 2013–2014 received ADHD medication (ISD Scotland, 2014). 

The worldwide prevalence of ADHD in children is estimated at 5%, with 1.5% of children meeting criteria for the more severe form known as hyperkinetic syndrome (Polanczyk _et al_ , 2007). This equates to 37 000 and 11 000 children in Scotland, respectively. There are an estimated 4539 children and young people with a diagnosis of ADHD in contact with specialist services (NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, 2008). This suggests that ADHD continues to be underestimated in the Scottish school-age population. 

Healthcare Improvement Scotland (2012) found a dearth of services for adults with ADHD, in contrast to the expanding situation in England and Wales. 

There is strong evidence that adults with ADHD respond to pharmacological treatments, medication being the first line of treatment in adults (Bolea _et al_ , 2012). 


 4 

Not detecting or treating ADHD has widespread ramifications for society in terms of family life, education, employment, healthcare and crime. The economic costs should not be underestimated (Kessler _et al_ , 2006). 

The Royal College of Psychiatrists requires all psychiatrists to be competent in neurodevelopmental assessment (Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2010). However, a recent survey by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland revealed an unmet need for training in the assessment of NDDs in adults, including ADHD. Of respondents, 32% of psychiatrists were not confident in assessing ADHD and other NDDs, and 67% wanted to have further training. 

Health boards must provide the necessary training opportunities to all relevant clinicians to develop their skills to the appropriate level of competence. All psychiatrists have a fundamental responsibility to ensure an appropriate level of competency in assessing and managing NDDs. 

Not all medications for ADHD in adults are licensed. The established expert in managing young people with ADHD and the substantial evidence base for use of these agents in adults justifies prescribing on an off-licence basis. 

We recognise that many psychiatrists are anxious that assessing and managing adults with ADHD may involve extra work for them, within a climate of resource austerity in health services. Nonetheless, we strongly recommend that all psychiatrists dealing with adults must be competent in diagnosing and managing ADHD. This disorder is common and found in all psychiatric subspecialties, often with comorbidities. It is likely that there are patients on existing case-loads who have undiagnosed ADHD. 

Service delivery needs to be planned to optimise use of resources. There is scope to learn from models employed by child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and paediatric services. Some investment will be required, but we do not anticipate that specialist services will be required within all health boards. 

We also recommend establishing a managed clinical network that develops and shares clinical experience, providing expertise that may not be available locally.

ADHD is one of a number of NDDs. ADHD and other NDDs frequently overlap; there is significant comorbidity with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), for example (Gillberg, 1983). 

An individual’s general activity levels, and their ability to pay attention, control impulses and regulate mood, are genetically weighted traits which are present from childhood. These traits are distributed as a spectrum in the population, modified by the environment and changeable with age. 

ADHD represents individuals who are at the extreme end of a spectrum in terms of degree of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Not all who are at these extremes have functional impairments or problems, and in certain circumstances these traits can be advantageous to individuals. However, those with ADHD are at substantially higher risk of developing secondary problems, particularly other psychiatric illnesses, substance misuse, and forensic, occupational, interpersonal and social problems (Kessler _et al_ , 2006). 

The need to demonstrate functional impairment or secondary disabilities is paramount in defining ADHD that may merit intervention; indeed, this forms part of the necessary diagnostic criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). 

Adults have to actively choose to manage their ADHD. Some may validly choose not to modify their ADHD in spite of apparent negative outcomes. The individual remains responsible for their behaviour irrespective of treatment. 

There are parallels between ADHD and personality disorders – both are trait-based, dimensional and represent individuals at one end of a spectrum. ADHD assessment can be similar to assessing for personality disorder – both require a longitudinal approach with corroborative evidence for diagnosis, and both require a collaborative approach to longer-term management. 

## ADHD as a diagnosis 

## in adults 


 6 

The general approach to assessing and managing ADHD is similar to that for any other mental disorder. 

Assessment of ADHD is not a clinical emergency. A good-quality assessment takes time and is ideally multidisciplinary, involving information gathered from a variety of sources such as third parties, previous school records and previous health assessments. Longitudinal assessment is also advised. 

Management of ADHD is proactively planned in collaboration with the patient. From the very start, the clinician should explicitly use an approach aimed at developing the patient’s own ability to self-manage over a lifelong period. Management involves a combination of pharmacological, psychological, educational and skills-based interventions. 

The clinician’s role is to advise on what interventions are likely to be beneficial. A specific task is to evaluate the balance between risk and benefit of prescribing medications. This is of particular importance given the frequent nature of off-licence prescribing. Prescribing should be safe. It is possible, for example, that drug treatment may be desirable, but that other risks (e.g. risk of diversion, poor social support making adherence poor) may outweigh the potential benefits. 

It is important to establish a threshold for impairment. This is a diagnostic requirement. Cut-off points for trait-based disorders can be difficult to define. 

## General principles in 

## assessing and managing 

## adults with ADHD 


We recommend that a threshold is set for referral to specialist services, as ADHD is a spectrum disorder and ADHD traits are ubiquitous. There needs to be evidence of a specific cluster of symptoms and significant impairment. 

We recommend that local services provide validated screening tools to referrers that confirm symptoms and the presence of impairment in two or more areas of function in those referred for an ADHD assessment. This helps ensure that only those at the more severe end are referred to secondary care services (Box 1). 

We recommend that local services encourage referrers to screen for other NDDs, particularly ASD, because of high rates of comorbidity. 

Patients may have had relevant assessments carried out by other health professionals (e.g. educational psychologists). We recommend that these should be made available when the referral is made. 

Clinicians should be mindful that there might be external pressures or agencies driving a request for referral. The motivation may not have arisen from the patient themselves. This may have a significant negative impact on engagement and on planning efficacious treatment, at the cost of clinical time.

As medication is first-line treatment, a relevant medical history is required of the referrer, particularly in terms of cardiovascular, neurological and hepatic disorders, including a record of the patient’s most recent blood pressure and pulse (Box 2). The role of the mental health practitioner in secondary care is to ensure that: 

 z a satisfactory evaluation for ADHD is conducted and criteria are met z other psychiatric conditions and other important contributory factors are identified and treated z there is appropriate liaison with other agencies and disciplines z a management plan is agreed with the patient; ADHD may not necessarily be the first priority for treatment z a risk–benefit analysis for ADHD medication is conducted z medication is titrated to a therapeutic dose while monitoring clinical response and any side-effects. z appropriate non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD are offered if available. 

Diagnostic reliability depends on a longitudinal assessment of the patient, together with third-party information. It is usually not possible to diagnose ADHD on the basis of a single assessment only. Assessment should be carried out on a multidisciplinary basis. There are freely available tools that can be used by mental health professionals to guide the assessment of ADHD (see ‘Assessment’, pp. 11–14). 

There are four common scenarios in which psychiatrists may encounter adult patients with ADHD, each group raising specific issues.

### Transition patients 

Diagnostic rates of ADHD in children and adolescents in Scotland remain below UK and European averages (0.6% of those below 20 years in 2014), but are rising towards the expected prevalence (ISD Scotland, 2014) 

Many young adults benefit from continuing treatment beyond the age of 18 (10% still meet criteria for the full syndrome, with up to 66% in partial remission) (Faraone _et al_ , 2006), and are therefore referred to adult services for specialist supervision. 

Protocols for transition may vary between areas and suggested standards have been developed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland Adult ADHD Working Group (Appendix 1). 

Drug treatment for ADHD in adults is often off-licence. The daily management of medication is often passed from the parent/carer to the young adult at this stage. 

Many young adults will initially attend with a parent who may have expectations of services based on their experiences of CAMHS. Young adults are frequently highly ambivalent about continuing ADHD treatment, and it is not unusual for young adults to stop treatment (McCarthy _et al_ , 2009). For this reason, it is important that part of the interview take place with the young person on their own to allow for expression of views that may differ from those of the parents. 

With this patient group, the basic roles of adult services are to: 

 z evaluate whether medication is still required (e.g. test out the effects of ‘drug holidays’) z monitor side-effects and/or adverse effects z identify and manage any psychiatric comorbidity z identify and provide appropriate non-pharmacological treatments. 

### Patients previously diagnosed 

### in childhood, re-referred for 

### treatment 

About 50% of children with ADHD do not require transition to adult services. Additionally, a further proportion may drop out of follow-up and treatment at transition. These adults may be re-referred looking to reinitiate ADHD treatment, particularly at times of life transitions or when experiencing major stressors that may augment the impairment associated with ADHD symptoms (Young _et al_ , 2011 _a_ ). 


 10 

Historically, such adults were often not referred because of lack of recognition of need, and lack of service provision. It follows that referrals from this group will increase disproportionately as awareness increases. 

CAMHS and paediatric services will have pertinent past information. Having this available would greatly reduce the time required to plan the future management of these individuals. Clinicians may need to request this information if it is not provided at time of referral, which may delay an initial assessment. 

As with any other medication, clinicians will need to conduct a risk– benefit analysis and discuss this with the patient before recommending pharmacological treatment, incorporating the specific risks associated with stimulant use. 

Patients diagnosed in other countries, or in non-NHS settings, should be encouraged to provide previous medical reports confirming diagnosis and treatment before the initial appointment. Without sufficient supporting evidence of a comprehensive diagnostic assessment, a standard assessment for ADHD will need to be carried out. General practitioners (GPs) referring those who have been diagnosed in other countries or in non-NHS settings should inform their patients that they will need to provide relevant medical reports in advance to expedite assessment and treatment. 

### Adult patients referred for 

### assessment of potential ADHD 

Parents of children with ADHD may seek assessment as they recognise their child’s traits within themselves or they may be alerted by their child’s clinician. This is unsurprising as ADHD is highly heritable. 

There is increased awareness in society of ADHD as a condition, which can be a trigger for referral requests. This is of particular relevance given the historical underrecognition of ADHD (Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland & Addressing the Balance, 2012) and probable missed diagnoses as a consequence. 

### Individuals already engaged with 

### mental health services 

There is evidence that many adults with undetected ADHD exist on the case-loads of community mental health teams (CMHTs). All members of the multidisciplinary team should have an awareness of the core features of ADHD and the potential for a missed primary or comorbid diagnosis (Deberdt _et al_ , 2015). 


 11 

## Assessment 

We suggest that in most cases, assessment and diagnosis of ADHD will require two to three 1 h sessions. It is important to stress that this process does not need to be rushed; by definition, these patients are likely to have experienced these difficulties for many years. For some, evidence for the diagnosis of ADHD may be fairly compelling by the end of the first 1 h appointment. For others, without clear evidence of the disorder, the process will end at this stage or may proceed to consider a different diagnosis. 

### General psychiatric history 

 z Assessment for symptoms of ADHD, with reference to DSM-5 criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). z Special attention should be paid to the age at onset of symptoms/behaviours (whether onset was before 12 years of age), the developmental history and any family history of ADHD and other NDDs (e.g. ASD, Tourette syndrome, dyslexia, dyspraxia). z Diagnosis in adults requires the presence of five symptoms, rather than the six required for children, in the categories of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. z Mental state examination should be completed in the normal way, taking into consideration that, in a novel setting, patients may not overtly display the core symptoms of the disorder. z Note that non-specific symptoms commonly presenting in adults with ADHD include affective instability. 


 12 

### Developmental history 

A comprehensive developmental history is critical. Contact with the following health professionals in infancy and childhood (up to 5 years of age) may indicate increased vulnerability to NDDs (Gillberg, 2010): 

 z speech and language therapists because of delayed/peculiar communication difficulties, social skills difficulties z occupational therapists because of motor skill difficulties, e.g. delays, tics, repetitive movements, stereotypies, coordination difficulties z health visitor (frequent visits) because of general developmental concerns z community or hospital-based paediatrics because of problems with toilet training, attention, activity, behaviour, mood and sleep regulation. 

See Appendix 2. 

### Corroborative history 

Because of the diagnostic importance of assessing childhood behaviour and establishing the onset of difficulties before the age of 12 years, obtaining a corroborative history is particularly important in the diagnosis of ADHD in adults. This should be emphasised to the patient and their family. 

Ideally, the opportunity should be sought to speak directly with a parent or relative who has known the individual since childhood (face to face or by telephone). This will also allow consolidation of the developmental history. Where this is not possible, other evidence of childhood behaviour, e.g. school report cards and other records, may be sought with patient consent. Some individuals with poor organisational skills may have difficulty facilitating this; consent could be sought to approach relatives or other informants directly. 

In certain circumstances, CAMHS and/or paediatric case notes, social work records and current college reports and/or work appraisals can additionally inform the assessment. 

Failure to obtain corroborative history should not exclude patients from diagnosis and treatment if these are otherwise indicated. 


 Assessment 13 

### Instruments to aid the diagnostic 

### process 

We recommend the use of validated instruments to support diagnosis as part of the assessment process, but it is not a substitute for careful history-taking and clinical evaluation of symptoms and degree of impairment. There are several validated tools available (Box 3). Additional screening tools can be sent to the patient in advance of the appointment or given to them to complete in the waiting area prior to the appointment. 

The Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults (DIVA) questionnaire (Kooij & Francken, 2010) is the most widely used diagnostic tool in the UK and may be a useful option. This is a structured interview that is simple to administer, and addresses current and childhood behaviours in addition to impairment, based on DSM criteria. It is freely available and, with practice, takes about an hour and a half to complete. Owing to the nature of the condition, completion of the DIVA in one session may not always be possible. 

Although neuropsychological assessments – e.g. the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) (Wechsler, 2008), test of everyday attention and Stroop test – are not routinely undertaken in the majority of cases, they can be helpful where the diagnosis remains unclear.

 14 

### Impairment of functioning 

The presence of significant impairment of functioning in two or more domains is a requirement for diagnosis. This is addressed in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013); it is also addressed in the DIVA questionnaire. The Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale (W-FIRS) is an additional tool that supports this (CADDRA, 2014). 

Impairment is particularly relevant in terms of deciding who to treat, and it is important to establish a robust threshold which clinicians can apply consistently. It must be remembered that treatment with medication is not risk free, and that the benefits are likely to be most marked in those with the most significant impairment. 

### Differential diagnosis 

There is considerable symptomatic overlap between ADHD and other major psychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorders, emotionally unstable personality disorder and anxiety disorders (Kessler _et al_ , 2006). Up to 90% of adults with ADHD experience mood instability that may resemble mood disorders or borderline personality disorders (Asherson, 2005). Mood instability may respond to treatment with medication for ADHD (Skirrow _et al_ , 2009). It is worth considering this diagnosis in those with lifelong difficulties who have significant functional impairment, present atypically and are difficult to treat. 

Psychotic symptoms are not core features of ADHD and may represent a comorbid diagnosis; such symptoms should be fully evaluated. Stimulant medication may trigger the emergence of psychotic symptoms. 

See Appendix 3 for more details. 


 15 

## Comorbidity 

Adults with ADHD are significantly more likely than the general population to experience other psychiatric disorders. In particular, mood and anxiety disorders, other NDDs and substance use disorders are potential comorbid conditions (Nutt _et al_ , 2007). Overlapping symptoms between disorders can make assessment difficult. A longitudinal history is helpful to elicit traitand state-based symptoms. Symptoms that are not part of an ADHD clinical picture can also be indicators to help with differentiation (see Appendix 3 for frequencies and overlapping and distinguishing features of different psychiatric disorders). 

The presence of other comorbid disorders should not be a barrier to conducting an assessment for ADHD. The nature of the comorbid condition will have an impact on the primacy of treatment. Major mood disorders should be treated prior to assessing for ADHD. Mood instability, as opposed to major mood disorder, in the context of ADHD often responds to pharmacological interventions for ADHD (Kooij _et al_ , 2010). 


 16 

When ADHD is complicated by comorbid NDDs such as ASD, which co-exist frequently, management and response to treatment are more complex (Antshel _et al_ , 2013). This will often become evident during the course of taking a competent neurodevelopmental history. Where specialist autism services exist, a joint approach is desirable. Comorbid psychosis is less common but can occur and can be more difficult to manage (Donev _et al_ , 2011). This document provides generalised guidance (see Fig. 1 for an overview of the assessment pathway); however, practice may need to be individualised for particular patient groups. 

### Substance misuse 

Substance misuse, mostly involving alcohol and cannabis, may be twice as common among individuals with ADHD as in the general population and tends to begin earlier (Breyer _et al_ , 2014). Individuals with untreated ADHD may also describe self-medicating with illicit substances. Some patients report paradoxical calming effects from stimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines. 

When prescribed stimulants are used appropriately, there is little evidence of patients becoming dependent, and indeed treating ADHD may reduce the lifetime risk of developing a substance use disorder (Biederman, 2003; Dalsgaard _et al_ , 2014). 

Controlled misuse should not completely preclude treatment, although careful monitoring will be required. In uncontrolled and chaotic patterns of drug and/or alcohol misuse, stimulant medications can be very difficult to manage safely and are not routinely recommended. Where there is a risk of recreational use of non-prescribed stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamines and some novel psychoactive substances, the patient should be warned of potential dangerous interactions with prescribed medication. 

Diversion of stimulants is often cited as a reason not to prescribe for this patient group (Wilens _et al_ , 2016). However, therapeutic stimulants, particularly long-acting formulations, appear to have limited street value, possibly owing to their pharmacokinetic properties (being slow to reach peak blood levels, they are not very effective at producing a ‘buzz’). Risk for diversion is significantly reduced with the use of slow-release preparations. Risks can also be minimised by supervised daily administration by third parties. Clinicians should be mindful of the use of these medications as cognitive enhancers in student populations (Wilens _et al_ , 2016). 

## Specific patient groups 


 Specific patient groups 17 

Significant and comorbid substance misuse should be managed jointly between general adult and addiction services in accordance with existing local protocols. 

### Intellectual disability 

The reported prevalence of ADHD in adults with intellectual disability varies widely. This variability is accounted for by the range of definitions and diagnostic criteria used. Prevalences of 16% have been reported across a wide range of severity (La-Malfa _et al_ , 2008). 

ADHD in the intellectually disabled population is associated with an increased occurrence of challenging behaviour, stereotypies, selfharm, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, tic disorders and sleep problems (Simonoff _et al_ , 2013). 

Drug and alcohol use during pregnancy, maternal infection, encephalitis and some genetic disorders (William’s syndrome, Turner syndrome, fragile-X syndrome and phenylketonuria) have been associated with ADHD in patients with intellectual disabilities (Dichter _et al_ , 2012; Green _et al_ , 2012). It is important to establish all possible aetiological factors before starting treatment for ADHD, as addressing these can improve symptoms of ADHD. 

People with intellectual disabilities have also been shown to be more sensitive to side-effects from medication (Simonoff _et al_ , 2013). 

### The forensic population 

Childhood ADHD has high rates of comorbidity with oppositional defiant disorders and conduct disorders. The presence of conduct disorder, in turn, is associated with the development of dissocial personality disorder in adults (Hofvander _et al_ , 2009). 

Adults with untreated ADHD are often bored, sensation seeking or impulsive; this combination of states can result in poor judgement, with criminal acts as a consequence. The prevalence of ADHD in the prison population is accepted to be much higher than in the general population, with estimates of between 25 and 40% (Ginsberg _et al_ , 2010). ADHD is associated with higher rates of comorbidity, worse quality of life and higher risks of suicidal behaviour (Young _et al_ , 2011 _b_ ). However, it is important to recognise that most people with ADHD do not commit crimes. Evidence suggests that treatment of ADHD in the prison population may reduce the risk of future offending (Lichtenstein _et al_ , 2012) 

The issue of criminal responsibility often arises. ADHD is not usually regarded as the type of mental condition which would give rise to a ‘not guilty by reason of mental disorder’ defence, but it has been accepted by at least one court as grounds for abnormality of mind 


 18 

in the context of a murder trial. It may be raised as general mitigation before the courts, and it may form the grounds for an assessment order under criminal procedure. Compulsory civil detention is not seen as appropriate under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003; our current understanding of the condition would suggest that it does not significantly impair decision-making ability. ADHD is a dimensional condition; its management requires a collaborative approach between clinician and patient that does not readily lend itself to compulsory measures or in-patient treatment. 

High rates of substance misuse are also described in this population. Supervised consumption of medication can help manage risks of diversion. Efforts should be made to ensure continuity of treatment on release from custodial settings by liaising with local services in advance.

### Implications of diagnosis 

When a new diagnosis of ADHD is made in adulthood, there can often be a sense of relief that an explanation has been found for lifelong difficulties. There may also be resentment that the diagnosis was not made earlier. 

It is important to frame ADHD as being a condition that the patient has a responsibility for managing, by promoting a sense of personal agency. 

Patients may be required to inform their employer or educational establishment. 

ADHD is also a notifiable condition for the DVLA (www.dvla.gov.uk). Patients should be informed that this is their responsibility. Treatment for ADHD has been shown to significantly improve driving safety (Jerome _et al_ , 2006). 

Education about ADHD is important. A variety of self-help books and websites exist for adults with ADHD (see Appendix 4 for details). 

Although diagnosis alone is all that some patients want, most will want to explore formal treatment options such as medication. 

### Treatment 

Medication is recommended as the first-line treatment for ADHD in adults with moderate to severe impairment (NICE, 2008). Table 1 gives an overview of medications used in adult ADHD. 

Drug treatments can be classified into stimulants (methylphenidate, dexamfetamine) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine, clonidine, bupropion etc.). Stimulants have an immediate action and can therefore be titrated more quickly. The mechanism of action of ADHD treatments involves increased availability of dopamine and/or noradrenaline at the synaptic level, with non-stimulants having a delayed onset of action similar to that of antidepressants. Stimulants have an appreciable positive effect on attention in those without ADHD, and a ‘therapeutic trial’ therefore has no diagnostic value. 

Stimulants have more potential for diversion/misuse, particularly immediate release preparations. 

Some treatments used for ADHD in adults are off-license. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has produced a consensus statement for 

## Management of ADHD 


 20 

use of licensed medicines for unlicensed uses (Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2007). Before prescribing, the clinician must ensure that the patient knows of the unlicensed use and understands the potential risks and benefits of the medication, that this is documented clearly, and that the patient is able to give fully informed consent. If prescribing responsibility is to be shared with primary care, the clinician should ensure that the risk assessment and consent issues are communicated to the GP. 

At the time of writing, atomoxetine and lisdexamfetamine are licensed for initiation and continuation in adults. Concerta XL (methylphenidate modified release) has a licence for continuation of treatment established in childhood into adulthood (Joint Formulary Committee, 2016). 

Although many treatments are not licensed in the adult population, this should not prevent medications being prescribed according to best practice. 

Pre-treatment screening should include measuring baseline ADHD symptom severity, impairment, weight, heart rate, blood pressure and sleeping pattern. ADHD treatments can exacerbate seizures and tics. A history of these conditions should be directly asked about. 

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is required if any of the following are present: family history or medical history of serious cardiac disease; family history of early cardiac death; or abnormal findings on cardiac exam. Further investigation and/or liaison with cardiology may be indicated in these situations. 

See the physical health checklist (Medical Assessment Tool for Adults with ADHD) in Appendix 5. 

##### Methylphenidate 

 z Recommended as the first line of treatment for ADHD in adults (NICE, 2008) z Primarily a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, with some action on noradrenaline and other catecholamines z It is a controlled drug z Effect size of 0.5 (Castels et al , 2011) z Immediate release preparations are cheaper and can allow greater fine-tuning of dosing. 

Modified release preparations contain a combination of both immediate and slow-release stimulants. These allow once-daily dosing and have less misuse potential. The difference between the various preparations is the ratio of immediate to slow release stimulant and duration of action. Alternatively, a combination of modified and immediate release preparations can be used to fine-tune symptom control at certain times of day. 


 Management of ADHD 21 

Dose titration, using immediate or slow release preparations, should be done using the smallest available dose increments over intervals (e.g. every fortnight), until an adequate response is achieved or intolerable side-effects are experienced. 

 z Typical starting dose (immediate release) 5 mg once or twice a day, increased to three times daily after a week. Dosage increased by about 10–15 mg per week dependent on tolerability. z Modified release: start at 10 mg (27 or 36 mg if Concerta XL), with weekly increases by increments of 10–20 mg (18 mg if Concerta XL) to maximum effective tolerated dose. z Monitor weight, blood pressure, pulse rate. 

##### Dexamfetamine 

 z Alternative stimulant treatment for ADHD in adults with similar efficacy to methylphenidate. z Used in patients with suboptimal response to methylphenidate. z Promotes the release, and prevents the reuptake, of dopamine and noradrenaline. It is a controlled drug. z Dexamfetamine is considered to have more misuse/diversion potential than methylphenidate although there is likely to be less misuse potential with lisdexamfetamine (Blick & Keating, 2007) owing to its pharmacokinetic profile. z Dose titration follows the same principles as for methylphenidate. 

##### Atomoxetine 

 z Non-stimulant treatment for ADHD which is usually considered in adults unresponsive or intolerant to stimulant treatments, or when misuse/diversion of stimulants is a concern. z A noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor; it is not a controlled drug. z Delayed onset of action of several weeks with effect size of 0.4 (Asherson et al 2014). z Does not require the same individuald fine-tuning of dose that stimulants require and has the advantage of once-daily dosing. z Side-effects are usually avoided by a gradual dose titration, for example starting at 40 mg and increasing by 20 mg per week. z Doses above 80 mg have not shown any additional benefit. Some individuals are poor metabolisers of atomoxetine and are sensitive to side-effects at low doses. Acute liver failure and suicidality are rare but significant potential side-effects. All patients should be advised of symptoms of these adverse events. z Monitor weight, blood pressure and pulse rate at baseline, after each dose change and long-term every 3 months, with weight every 6 months. z Increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias has been described when used with drugs that prolong the QTc interval.

##### Other pharmacological options 

 If there is inadequate response to monotherapy, then combining a stimulant with atomoxetine is occasionally done in clinical practice, although there is a limited evidence base for this. Other potential treatment options, which have less of an evidence base, include: 

 z bupropion (Zyban) – dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor z modafinil (Provigil) – dopamine reuptake inhibitor z clonidine – alpha agonist z nortriptyline or desipramine – potent inhibitors of noradrenaline reuptake. 


 Management of ADHD 23 

##### Psychological treatments 

NICE clinical guideline CG72 recommends that drug treatments for ADHD should be part of a comprehensive treatment programme addressing psychological, behavioural, occupational and educational needs (NICE, 2008). However, the evidence base for the effectiveness of individual psychological therapies for ADHD in adults is insufficiently robust at present for NICE to make any specific recommendations. 

Nevertheless, approaches utilising cognitive–behavioural therapy and coaching strategies can be useful in practice as adjuncts to medication and in cases where medication is contraindicated or not tolerated. Group-based interventions using these techniques have been developed, e.g. the Young–Bramham programme (Young & Bramham, 2012). 

It is also envisaged that many patients with ADHD could potentially benefit from the practical and emotional support offered to other patients by multidisciplinary mental health teams. In particular, the input of occupational therapists can be very useful in terms of helping patients to structure their time and improve organisational skills, and in assisting with access to further education and/or employment. Although it may not be possible with existing resources to offer this consistently to all patients with ADHD, it is important that all multidisciplinary staff within CMHTs begin to develop an understanding of ADHD and its management in adults. 

### Monitoring of medication 

Weight, blood pressure and heart rate, in addition to side-effect monitoring, should be completed at each dose titration review and every 6 months once stabilised. See Appendix 5 for a checklist (Monitoring treatment in ADHD). 

##### Assessing response to medication 

During dose titration, enquiry should be made about reduction in core ADHD symptoms (as described in DSM-5), associated symptoms (mood instability, ceaseless mental activity), functioning and possible side-effects. There are side-effect rating scales available; see Appendix 5. 

For stimulants, enquiry about how long the effects last is important in tailoring the dose. It is possible to combine a slow release preparation to be given in the morning, with an immediate release preparation in the evening, if additional symptom control in the evening is required. 

Not all ADHD symptoms can be ameliorated with treatment; it is important to manage expectations of treatment. 


 24 

Some patients find the reduction in ADHD symptoms disconcerting; a dose reduction may need to be considered. 

Possible scales that may be used in assessing response include the Current Behaviour Scale (CBS) (Murphy & Barkley, 1996) and the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale (W-FIRS) (Weiss _et al_ , 2007). 

##### Comorbidity 

It is usually preferable to treat any comorbid mental health problem before treating ADHD (see Appendix 3). Stimulants can potentially trigger or exacerbate psychosis, mania and tics, primarily via their dopaminergic effect. However, atomoxetine may in fact be helpful for anxiety disorders (Kratochvil _et al_ , 2005). 

Before starting ADHD treatments it may be necessary to optimise existing treatments and weigh up the potential risks of starting ADHD treatment. 

##### Duration of treatment 

Once an acceptable dose has been achieved that balances efficacy with side-effects, this dose should be continued and reviewed at least annually. With stimulants, the need for ongoing treatment can be evaluated by ‘drug holidays’. Often this occurs naturally through omission of doses. 

Treatment can allow patients to develop new ways of coping with residual symptoms. This, along with the general trend for symptoms to improve with age, means the need for ongoing treatment should be reviewed. It has been suggested that this be done on an annual basis (Kolar _et al_ , 2008). 

Discontinuation of treatment should be done gradually with non-stimulants to avoid withdrawal effects, but stimulants can be withdrawn more rapidly. 


 25 

## Service design 

Diagnostic rates in Scotland suggest under-detection of ADHD in children (NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, 2008). As awareness and diagnostic rates increase, an increased demand on adult services is likely to follow. Health boards should develop proactive strategies to meet the predictable increase in need for this adult group, in line with recommendations (Scottish Government, 2012). 

### Service models 

It is our opinion that general adult services are best placed to manage this condition, given the high levels of comorbidity and the high prevalence of the disorder. Although upskilling existing mental health professionals may increase capacity to a certain extent, it is likely that services will need organisation and expansion to efficiently meet the needs of adults with ADHD. 

In Scotland, a variety of service models exist for managing ADHD in adults. In the majority of health boards, adult ADHD is managed within existing general adult services. In Glasgow, a tiered approach has been proposed where all general psychiatrists manage adult ADHD, with each sector having an identified clinician who can offer more specialist advice to local clinicians as needed. In NHS Lothian, a specialist consultation service at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital has been developed. The different service models each have their own advantages and disadvantages. When considering different service models, issues around population, training, staffing and finance should be considered. 

Young people’s services have already negotiated these challenges and have come up with a number of models of care, for example, nurse-led ADHD clinics, nurse prescribers and shared care protocols. Adult services could capitalise on this experience to find solutions for service provision. 


 26 

### Referrals 

We recommend that local services provide validated screening tools to referrers. Some suggested instruments were described earlier in this document (Box 1, p. 7). 

Patients have often had relevant assessments carried out by other health professionals (e.g. educational psychologists or private clinicians). We recommend that these should be made available when the referral is made. 

As medication is first-line treatment, a relevant medical history is required from the referrer, particularly in terms of cardiovascular, neurological and hepatic disorders. This should include a record of the patient’s most recent blood pressure and pulse (Box 2, p. 8). 

We recommend that local services develop agreed transition protocols from child to adult services. Standards for such protocols have been developed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland ADHD Working Group (Appendix 1). 

### Diagnosis and treatment 

There is scope for the development of shared care protocols with primary care for longer-term management, similar to those in use by CAMHS. Some health boards already have shared care protocols in place for ADHD in adults. 

We recommend that local services allocate adequate time for clinicians assessing and treating ADHD. Diagnostic assessments usually take 2–3 appointments of 1-hour duration. 

There are freely available tools that can be used by mental health professionals to guide the assessment of ADHD (e.g. the DIVA; Kooij & Francken, 2010). We recommend that local adult services create a central resource of such tools that clinicians can access easily. 

We recommend that a managed clinical network be set up to share skills and expertise in adult ADHD. 


 27 

## Training 

It is a requirement for all trainees in psychiatry to demonstrate competency in the recognition of NDDs. Training programmes should reflect this need. 

There is also a requirement to upskill existing career grade psychiatrists and consultants through provision of appropriate continuing professional development (CPD). Opportunities for training include the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ CPD Online (www.psychiatrycpd. co.uk) and various national training courses, including those provided by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland. However, this does not negate the need for locally organised clinical training and opportunities for supervision. 

Given the high prevalence of adult ADHD and its comorbidities, all members of the multidisciplinary team are likely to encounter patients with this disorder and should have sufficient awareness of the disorder to refer possible cases for assessment. The ability to deliver non-pharmacological interventions and to contribute to case management is also essential and is likely to require additional training. Health boards must ensure that these training needs are met.

### Background 

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the term most commonly used to cover a group of common, chronic behavioural disorders characterised by persistent, pervasive and disabling levels of restlessness and overactivity (usually combined with impulsiveness) and/or inattention, beyond developmental norms. The DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) identified three subtypes of ADHD, and the ICD-10 (World Health Organization, 1992) describes hyperkinetic disorder (HKD), which is similar to the most severe form of ADHD in DSM-IV. However, the term ‘ADHD’ is commonly used in the UK even by specialists; therefore, it will be used in this document. 

ADHD services for under-18s have been developed in Scotland over the past 15–20 years, but there is a lack of service provision for over18s with ADHD (Healthcare Improvement Scotland, 2012). This is of concern because: (a) those already identified and receiving treatment in childhood often need continuing care; and (b) there are many adults whose ADHD has not yet been identified or whose symptomatology has been misdiagnosed (Nutt _et al,_ 2007), leading to members of this group not accessing potentially beneficial treatments. 

Longitudinal studies of ADHD show continuing decline of symptoms with age, but about half of adults who had a childhood diagnosis of ADHD still experience functional impairment (Coghill _et al_ , 2008). Clearly, services for the assessment and treatment of adults with ADHD need to be developed (Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland & Addressing the Balance, 2012). 

The Mental Health Strategy for Scotland (Scottish Government, 2012) acknowledges the need to develop appropriate specialist capability for diagnosis and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders within adult services. The TRACK study findings (Singh _et al_ , 2010) highlight that young people with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD are more likely to fall through the gap between child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and adult mental health services (AMHS), and transition arrangements are noted to be more complex for this group. This document focuses on transition arrangements for those already receiving input from CAMHS and who require continuing specialist input beyond their 18th birthday. 


 Appendix 1: Transition guidance 33 

### Data 

The prevalence of ADHD in school-age children and young people is approximately 5%, and that of the most severe form of ADHD (i.e. HKD) is approximately 1–2% (Polanczyk _et al_ , 2007). However, the actual number of young people given a diagnosis of ADHD in Scotland is much less than this. Healthcare Improvement Scotland (2012) reported that only 0.6% of children and adolescents were receiving treatment for ADHD; furthermore, the range among National Health Service (NHS) boards was 0.21–1.17% in 2011–2012. In the same year, Information Services Division (ISD) data showed that 0.6% of under18s in Scotland were receiving medication licensed for treatment of ADHD – again, with a variation in rates between NHS boards (ISD Scotland & National Services Scotland, 2012). It is highly likely that the 0.6% receiving treatment have the more severe form of ADHD and are more likely to need ongoing treatment into adulthood. ISD have also described a significant upward trend in the number of prescriptions provided for ADHD medications in recent years, with a 7.1% increase in the period 2010/11 to 2011/12 for both underand over-18s. This also highlights an increasing number of young adults taking medication for ADHD who may require continued care over the age of 18 years. 

### Services for adults with ADHD in 

### transition 

Healthcare Improvement Scotland (2012) found that transition arrangements to AMHS were on a case-by-case basis and that there were no established dedicated ADHD services within AMHS. Some NHS boards reported that shared care protocols were being developed with general practitioners (GPs). 

Key clinical issues in providing an effective service for the diagnosis and management of ADHD in young people in transition are: 

 z Ensuring that appropriate referral pathways are in place for young people to support a smooth transition between CAMHS or paediatric services and adult services (including AMHS, substance misuse services and primary care) z Ensuring that offender management services have appropriate referral pathways for young people z Providing effective and efficient clinical care in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, 2008) clinical guideline CG72 on ADHD, and ensuring appropriate treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders z Ensuring that the service is integrated with other health and social services for young people and adults with ADHD 


 34 

 z Ensuring responsive engagement with the third sector z Providing the best possible outcomes for individual people/ patients, their carers and local communities z Providing a quality-assured service 

### Service components 

NICE (2008) recommends that young people with ADHD receiving treatment and care from CAMHS or paediatric services should normally be transferred to adult services if they continue to have significant symptoms of ADHD and/or coexisting conditions that require treatment. Health boards should ensure that referral criteria are agreed between CAMHS/paediatrics and AMHS for cases accepted through a transition protocol. The role of primary care for ongoing monitoring and prescribing should be clear, with recommendations of situations, such as complex comorbidity, when AMHS should be consulted. Local agreements with GPs and AMHS will vary. 

Transition should be planned by both referring and receiving services. An assessment to establish the need for continuing treatment into adulthood should be carried out. Flexibility in the timing of transition is important. The precise timing of arrangements may vary locally but should usually be completed by the time the young person is 18 years old. Transition arrangements should normally include: 

 z the involvement of the young person and, when appropriate, the parent or carer in the planning (see Box 1). z provision of information about adult services to the young person z details of the anticipated treatment and services that the young person will require. 

For more complex cases: 

 z consideration of a planning meeting involving paediatric services or CAMHS and AMHS and/or a joint appointment. 

### Developing a high-quality ADHD 

### service specifically for young 

### people in transition 

To deliver an effective service to young people beyond the age of 18 years, NHS boards will need to formalise arrangements for the management of adults with ADHD. This can be achieved through the development of local care pathways addressing adequate transition planning, good information transfer across teams, joint working between teams, and continuity of care following transition. NICE (2013) have produced a commissioning guide to support the development of services for adults with ADHD. Appropriate training for multidisciplinary 


 Appendix 1: Transition guidance 35 

staff in mental health services and for GPs must be made available to achieve this. Shared care protocols between secondary and primary care would facilitate this process.

 Box 1 Transition of young people with ADHD to adult services 

 z Identify a young person over the age of 17 who is likely to benefit from continued medication and contact with services when they reach the age of 18. z Alert adult services about the young person with a written referral (specifying the reason for referral) and case summary. For complex cases consider a joint meeting between adult and child services. The case summary should have clarity regarding the following. z The clinical evidence/grounds for diagnosis of ADHD, including details of assessment (e.g. results of questionnaires and school assessment) z Interventions to date (pharmacological, psychological, educational) z Degree of engagement of young person (and/or parents/carers) in treatment and follow-up z Preferred clinic location (if there is a choice) z Preference with respect to whom appointment letters should be addressed, e.g. to the individual alone; the individual plus parent/carer z Details of the anticipated treatment and services that the young person will require z Current symptoms of ADHD and associated social, academic and family impairments; how stable/unstable the individual is on treatment and predictions regarding future crises/challenges z The context of the young person with regard to: 

- education/employment 

- current social circumstances, significant relationships/supports 

- peer relationships z Forensic history z Quality of life/activities of daily living z Benefits/employment status z Driving status z Current medication, dosage, side-effects, benefits z Medication history: 

- objective measures of improvements on medication 

- reasons for choice and change of medications 

- dates/duration of treatment, maximum dose achieved and medication-free     periods z Comorbid conditions including drug or alcohol misuse z Specific intellectual difficulties (a formal diagnosis of intellectual disability would mean a direct referral to the Learning Disability Service)

## Appendix 3: Comorbidity 

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and differentiating comorbid conditions 

Disorder Comorbidrate Shared symptoms Differentiating symptoms 

Specific intellectual difficulty 

 33% Problems with concentration, poorly organised work, forgetfulness, poor time management 

 Presence of academic skills deficits (dyscalculia, dyslexia) 

Emotionally unstable personality disorder 

 13% Problems with concentration, poorly organised work, forgetfulness, poor time management 

 Chronic feelings of emptiness Presence of identity disturbance Suicide threats or acts of self-harm Fear of abandonment Quasi-psychotic symptoms 

Dissocial personality disorder (DSPD) 

 24% Enduring pervasive pattern of behaviour that causes impairment in multiple domains Low tolerance to frustration Problems maintaining relationships Conduct disorder can coexist with ADHD and has been invariably present in DSPD History of hyperactivity in childhood in ADHD and DSPD 

 Callous unconcern for feelings of others Incapacity to experience guilt Persistent attitude of irresponsibility and disregard for social norms, rules and obligations 

Anxiety disorder Inconsistent findings, some studies report elevated rates up to 33% 

 Poor concentration Motor tension Inability to switch thoughts off Checking may be employed in ADHD as a means of managing forgetfulness/disorganisation 

 Autonomic overactivity Presence of somatic symptoms Persistent anxiety symptoms of an episodic nature (periods where symptoms not present) Evidence of clear triggers to anxiety (presence of avoidance) Specific focus to thought content, e.g. fear of negative appraisal, contamination, threat Implications for treatment Treat clear anxiety disorder first Re-evaluate severity of ADHD once anxiety disorder treated Consider atomoxetine if stimulant treatment exacerbates anxiety symptoms 

Moderate to severe depressive disorder 

 63% Poor self-esteem Affective instability Irritability Poor concentration Sleep problems 

 Episodic history of pervasive low mood and/or anhedonia (different to usual mental state), presence of somatic syndrome Treatment implications: treat depression first 

Dysthymia 23% Poor concentration Problems making decisions Irritability Sleep problems Low self-esteem Feeling incapable 

 Chronically depressed mood present for minimum of 2 years Treatment implications: treat ADHD first 


 42 

ADHD in adults and differentiating comorbid conditions (continued) 

Disorder Comorbidrate Shared symptoms Differentiating symptoms 

Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) 

 20% Mania/ADHD Affective instability Hyperactivity/impulsivity Sleep problems Depression (see p. 41) 

 BPAD has an episodic presentation with distinct periods of abnormal moods (hypomanic/manic, depressed) with a return to baseline level of functioning in between episodes; psychotic symptoms may be present Implications for treatment: treat mood disorder first 

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 

 No adult studies; now recognised that conditions frequently co-occur 

 Severe hyperactivity in childhood, social impairment, poor concentration. Developmental coordination disorder often coexists with either ADHD or ASD 

 Attentional problems centred around not listening and problems shifting focus (attentional problems in ADHD due to short attention span and excessive distractibility) Impairment of reciprocal social interactions All-absorbing narrow interest Imposition of routines and interest Non-verbal communication problems Speech and language problems (formal, pedantic, odd prosody, staccato speech) 

Substance use disorders 

 25% (earlier onset of substance misuse) 

 Impulsivity Overactivity Poor concentration 

 Use of one or more psychoactive drugs causing damage to health with or without dependence syndrome Treatment implications: stabilise substance misuse first Make ADHD diagnosis when patient in recovery Consider drug interactions and risk of diversion. If risk of diversion, nonstimulant treatment should be used 

Neurological disorders, tic disorder, epilepsy 

 Implications for treatment Tic disorder: if severe, use nonstimulant Epilepsy: optimise seizure control. Liaise with neurology. Some anticonvulsant medications have a negative impact on attention. Monitor for deterioration in seizure control with stimulant 

Developmental coordination disorder 

 40% in children (75% persist into adulthood) 

 Problems with planning, working memory Restlessness Poor concentration 

 Presence of motor coordination difficulties, hypo/hypertonia
