## Disclosures 

Nothing to disclose. 


###### Data on Child and Adolescent Suicide 

- Suicide is the second leading cause of death for children, 

 adolescents, and young adults age 5-to-24-year-olds. 

- The majority of children and adolescents who attempt suicide 

 have a significant mental health disorder, usually depression. 

- Among younger children, suicide attempts are often impulsive. 

 They may be associated with feelings of sadness, confusion, anger, or problems with attention and hyperactivity. 


###### Data on Child and Adolescent Suicide 

- Among teenagers, suicide attempts may be associated with     feelings of stress, self-doubt, pressure to succeed, financial     uncertainty, disappointment, and loss. For some teens, suicide may     appear to be the **only** solution to their problems. 

- Thoughts about suicide and suicide attempts are often associated     with depression. 


###### Suicide in Children under 12 

- Between 1993 and 2012 a total of 657 children between the ages of     5 to 11 died by suicide. (CDC) 

- About 84 percent of the deaths occurred among boys. 

 Hanging and suffocation were the most common methods employed 

- The suicide rate nearly doubled among African-American children     during those years while it fell among white children 


## Prevalence 


###### Cultural Considerations 

- Suicide rates are also on the rise for African-American adolescents,     particularly among males. 

- Many factors – including increased exposure to violence and     traumatic stress; early onset of puberty; and lower likelihood to seek     help for depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts may     come to explain this. 

- Girls attempt suicide more than boys, a particular problem for girls     from Hispanic backgrounds 


###### Emphasis is on Prevention not Prediction 

- There is no way to predict who will and who will not go on to     attempt suicide and overall. 

- Actuarial methods, clinical judgement and self-report methods are     inherently flawed and will not capture everyone who is at **imminent**     risk. 

- **Clinical judgment is the key factor to prevention.** What can and     cannot be modified at this moment. 

- Most people who inherently have risk factors for suicide will **not**     engage in suicidal behaviors. 


###### Risk and Protective Factors 

- **Risk factors** – Increase likelihood that a young person will engage in     suicidal behavior (Mostly distal factors)        Intrapersonal, Social/situational, cultural environmental 

- **Protective factors** – Mitigate or eliminate risk 

 Intrapersonal, Social/situational, cultural, environmental 

- These are the reasons for living that the child gives to you     i.e. “Why I haven’t or won’t take my life.” 


###### Risk Factors: Intrapersonal 

- Mental disorders (particularly depression) 

- Hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, worthlessness 

- Previous suicide attempt 

- Alcohol and other substance use disorders 

- Disciplinary problems 

- High risk behaviors 

- Sexual orientation confusion 

- Male gender (Girls have higher rate of attempts) 


###### Risk Factors: Social/Situational 

- Recent or serious loss (e.g., death, divorce, separation, 

 broken relationship; self-esteem; loss of interest in friends, hobbies, or activities previously enjoyed) 

- Family history of suicide 

- Witnessing family violence 

- Child abuse or neglect 

- Lack of social support 

- Sense of isolation and non-belongingness 

- Victim of bullying or being a bully 


Risk Factors: Cultural/Environmental 

- Access to lethal means (i.e. firearms, pills) –Modifiable 

- Stigma associated with asking for help 

- Barriers to accessing services – Modifiable 

- Lack of bilingual service providers – Modifiable 

- Unreliable transportation - Modifiable 

- Financial costs of services – Modifiable 

- Cultural and religious beliefs (e.g., belief that suicide is noble     resolution of a personal dilemma) 


Protective Factors aka “Reasons for Living” 

- Skills in problem solving, conflict resolution and handling problems in     a non-violent way 

- Strong connections to family, friends, and community support 

- Restricted access to highly lethal means of suicide 

- Cultural and religious beliefs that discourage suicide and support     self-preservation 


###### Protective Factors Continued 

- Easy access to a variety of clinical interventions 

- Effective clinical care for mental, physical, and substance use     disorders 

- Support through ongoing medical and mental health care     relationships 

- MAKE NO ASSUMPTIONS. VERIFY THAT PATIENT DOES REALLY SEE IT     AS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR. 


##### Warning Signs 

- A warning sign does not mean automatically that a person is going to     attempt suicide, but it should be responded to in a serious &     thoughtful manner  

- Do not dismiss a threat as a cry for attention! 

- Children and adolescents thinking about suicide may make openly     suicidal statements or comments such as, "I wish I was dead," or "I     won't be a problem for you much longer."

Screening in Primary Care Setting 

**Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) [http://cssrs.columbia.edu/](http://cssrs.columbia.edu/)** 

- **Simple.** Ask all the questions in a few moments or minutes — with no mental health training     required to ask them. Anyone can use it, including counselors, nurses, teachers, students,     coaches, resident assistants, and social workers. 

- **Efficient.** Use of the C-SSRS redirects resources to where they’re needed most. It reduces     unnecessary referrals and interventions by more accurately identifying who needs help — and it     makes it easier to correctly identify the level of support a person needs, such as patient safety     monitoring procedures, counseling, or emergency room care. 

- **Effective.** Real-world experience and data show that the scale has helped prevent suicide. 

- **Free.** The scale and the training on how to use it are available free of charge for use in     community and healthcare settings, as well as in federally funded or nonprofit research. 

- **Universal.** The C-SSRS is suitable for all ages and special populations in different settings and is     available in more than 100 country-specific languages. The scale was originally created for use     with children and is available in versions specifically for younger children, as well as for those     with autism or other developmental or intellectual disabilities. 

- **Evidence-supported.** An unprecedented amount of research has validated the relevance and     effectiveness of the questions used in the C-SSRS to assess suicide risk, making it the most     evidence-based tool of its kind. 


SUICIDE IDEATION DEFINITIONS AND PROMPTS: (^) monthPast Ask questions that are in bold and underlined.

Communicating with Suicidal Patients 


### “Are you suicidal?” 

- The patient may not identify their experience as being     “suicidal” 

- They are hopeless and in pain and just want the pain to     stop. 

- “Suicidal” may carry stigma in mind of patient (crazy,     mentally ill, etc.) 

- Patient may think you and others would view them as     being weak, with no resilience 

- Patient fears you may over-react 

- Individuals who are genuinely intent on taking their     lives do not want you or anyone else to thwart or     prevent their efforts. 


###### “How are you feeling?” 

###### (Too Broad) 

- Likely to be met with a rote, socially acceptable reply: “fine.” 

- Commits patient to “being well” and patient loses face if they     have to amend their answer later in the interview. 


Avoid Using Psychological Jargon or Evasive Questions 

“Are you having thoughts of hurting yourself or others?” “Do you feel you are a danger to yourself or others?” 

- Affront to self-esteem:      Patient considers self a decent person who does not wish to “hurt” others,        and does not want to be considered dangerous or a menace to society 

- Implies a Taboo:      They know, at a certain level that we are referring to suicide, but because        we side-stepping a direct question, we give subtle message that the subject is        shameful or taboo. 

- Impersonal:      It distances the questioner from a sincere inquiry; we are trying to check-        off a box on a form and move on, rather than listen to what the patient is        actually experiencing 


## Asking the Negative 

_“You’re not having any thoughts of suicide, are you?”_ 

- Implies you do not want to hear an affirmative answer 


###### DO ASK Open-ended Questions 

- “In what situations do you think it’s okay to take your own life?” 

- “If you were dead, who do you think would miss you?” 

- “What do you hope will soon be different?” 

- “ You said that you thought about killing yourself last week. What     stopped you?” 

Asking questions in this manner will get the patient to tell you the reasons that they want to live. 

Remember: Patient ambivalence buys you and them time to come to another way of thinking. 


###### Validate and Normalize 

Overcoming a client’s anxiety or hesitancy by letting them know that others have experienced the same thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. 

Underlying Principles: 

- Clients are more apt to give valid details if they think their     experience is “normal.” 

Example: 

- “ _Many of my patients tell me that, at times, the pain of their_     _depression can be so great that they have thoughts of wanting to kill_     _themselves. Have you ever had any thoughts like that?”_ 

Avoid correcting their thinking as it will only shut them down more. Validate their pain and experience. 


###### Involving Parents/Guardians 

- Does the patient’s family know about their suicidal thoughts? If not,     what is the patient’s hesitation? 

- How do they think their family would react? 

- Let the patient know why you think it is in their interest to enlist     their family’s aid. 

- Let consumer decide how much they are comfortable sharing 

_“How would you like your family to ask if you are feeling like things are getting really bad?”_ 


## Tips for Parents 

- Prioritize interacting with them in positive ways 

- Increase their involvement in positive, life-affirming experiences 

- Monitor **appropriately** child’s whereabouts and communications     (i.e., texting, Facebook, Twitter) with the goal of keeping them safe 


## Tips for Parents 

- Get involved and be aware of child's friends 

- Communicate regularly with other parents in the community 

- Do whatever possible to eliminating the means for suicidal behavior     in the home. 

- Communicate regularly with the child’s school to ensure optimal     safety and care for the child in the school setting 


## Tips for Parents 

- Talk with your child about your concerns and ask directly about     suicidal thoughts 

- Explain value of therapy and potential for medication management     of symptoms 

- Address your concerns with other important adults in your child’s     life 

- Discuss concerns with your child’s doctor to get appropriate mental     health referrals 

- Talk with people in the school who can provide support and     guidance 


###### When to Call Mobile Crisis/Police 

- The child endorses a realistic and organized method to kill     themselves, reports having access to means for suicide and     verbalizes positive intent to execute same. 

- Recent “acts of furtherance.” (Child already began the process) 

- Parents report feeling that they are unable to keep the suicidal child     safe at home without placement in an acute psychiatric unit where     they are directly observed 24 hours per day. 

- Suicidal child presents as very agitated in office and you believe there     is a strong possibility of violent behaviors. 

- If parents insist on transporting child to closest ED, contact local     police to have them provide escort and ensure that child gets there. 


###### Intervention Programs 

- Psychotherapy is an important component in the management of     suicidal ideation and behaviors 

- There are two documented effective psychotherapies for treating     those who attempt suicide:         Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)         Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) for youth diagnosed with           borderline personality disorder and recurrent suicidal ideation
