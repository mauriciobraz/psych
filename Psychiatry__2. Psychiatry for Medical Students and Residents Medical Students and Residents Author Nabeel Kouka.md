###### Mental Status Examination 

! The mental status examination is used to describe the clinician’s observations & impression of the patient during the interview. In conjunction with the history of the patient, it is the best way to make an accurate diagnosis. ! **General Description** o **Appearance** : grooming, poise, clothes, body type (disheveled, neat, childlike) o **Behavior** : quantitative & qualitative aspects of motor behavior (restless, tics) o **Attitude** toward the examiner: (cooperative, frank & seductive) ! **Speech** o The physical characteristics of speech (Rate, clarity, volume, rhythm, relevancy, coherency, fluency) ! **Mood & Affect** o **Mood** : Predominant emotional state of patient (depressed, anxious, angry) o **Affect** : Expression of patient’s present emotional responsiveness, appropriateness, variability (range; labile), intensity (blunted, flat) o **_Congruent_** when Mood & Affect are the same o **_Incongruent_** when Mood & Affect are opposite each other ! **Thought** o **Form** ( **Process** ) of thought ! The way in which a person thinks (flight of ideas, loose associations, Tangentially “point of conversation never reached” & circumstantiality) o **Content** of thought ! What the person thinking about (delusions, idea of reference, thought insertion/withdrawal, broadcasting, paranoia, obsession, compulsion, phobia, suicidal ideas) ! **Appropriateness** o In reference to the context of the subject (appropriate or inappropriate) ! **Perceptual Disturbances** o Experienced in reference to self or the environment (hallucinations, illusions, dissociative states “depersonalization & derealization”) ! **Sensorium & Cognition** ( **_Mini Mental Status Exam_** ) o **_Alertness_** & level of **_Consciousness_** : (awake, clouding of consciousness, etc.). o **_Orientation_** : time, place, and person. o **_Concentration_** & **_Attention_** : serial sevens, serial threes, spell backwards o **_Memory_** : recent, remote, recent past, and immediate retention and recall. o **_Language_** ( **Read** & **Write** ): Ability to read a sentence & perform what it says o **Visuospatial Ability** : Copy a figure !

###### Interviewing Techniques 

 ! Open-Ended Questions o Allow the patient to speak in his own words as much as possible o Not YES or NO answers: “Can you tell me about the voices?” ! Closed-Ended Questions o Ask for specific information without allowing options in answering o YES or NO answers: “Are you hearing voices?” ! Facilitation o Physician helps the patient continue by providing verbal and nonverbal cues o “Yes, please, continue” !

Reassurance o If truthful, can lead to increased compliance ! “We both know that what you have is serious” Truthful o If false, can lead to decreased compliance ! “Everything will be alright” False ! Leading o The answer is suggested in the question o “Are voices telling you to hurt yourself?” 

###### Psychiatric Tests 

**Intelligence Tests** ! **Intelligence Quotient** (IQ) measures academic performance **IQ = MA** / **CA** X **100 MA =** Mental Age (Performance Score) **CA =** Chronological Age (Actual Age) **Mean IQ = 100 + 1 SD** ( **SD = 15** ) ! Adults o Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised ( **WAIS-R** ) ! Children o Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Revised ( **WISC-R** ) !

###### CNS Development 

**CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PERIODS** ! As you develop, you make more and neuronal (synaptic) interconnections, utilizing fewer and fewer neurons.

The monkeys died o Raised in similar cage, but arm and nipple were covered by terry cloth, providing snugly cutaneous touch: ! They survived to become antisocial but had no reproductive success o Raised as in (2) but they saw a picture of a simple face reproductive success. They had more success than the other groups though ! Grew up to be nerd monkeys and tried to interact with other monkeys but had very little reproductive success. They had more success than the other groups though. **CRECHE SYNDROME** ! Baby’s denied love in neonatal period have higher mortality & morbidity rate !
