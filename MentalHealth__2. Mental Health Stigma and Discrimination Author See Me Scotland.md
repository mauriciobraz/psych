**Introduction** In order to be able to help support the development of successful learners and effective contributors, it is essential to underscore the importance of mental health and wellbeing as essential to fulfilling potential and achieving higher levels of attainment. 

To deliver the resource materials confidently and consistently, young people and staff need a basic foundation in mental health stigma and discrimination. Issues to explore include predominant conditions, the impact of stigma, coping strategies and resilience, as well as the associated implications on a personal level. 

People with mental health conditions have long experienced prejudice and discrimination. Public stigma is the most prominent form observed and studied, as it represents the prejudice and discrimination directed at a group by the larger population. Self-stigma occurs when people internalise these public attitudes and suffer numerous negative consequence. As a result approaches to tackling mental health stigma and discrimination must be multi-faceted to have a sustained and lasting impact. 

**The impact of stigma** A key to challenging self-stigma is to promote personal empowerment on both an individual and societal level. 

Stigma related to internal and subsequent behavioural processes can lead to social isolation, and additional negative stereotypes such as notions of dangerousness can be harmful to people living with mental health conditions. Emotional reactions drive discrimination and can contribute to having negative thoughts and feelings about a person 

 in a stigmatised group. Self-stigma presents as a series of stages: awareness, agreement with stigma, application of the stigma to themselves and finally harm to self (withdrawal/isolation). This can result in life limitation, worse recovery outcomes and a decreasing sense of self-worth for the individual. Conversely a belief in your ability to achieve what you set out to do and reach your potential, and 'coming out' about mental health problems are thought to be effective mechanisms in reducing self-stigma. 

 Empowering individuals is an effective way of reducing self-stigmatisation and encouraging people to believe they can achieve life goals; empowerment in a sense is the flip side of stigma. Research has demonstrated empowerment to be associated with high self-esteem, better quality of life and increased social support. 


**Ending mental health stigma** Addressing mental health stigma and discrimination with young people is only one step towards creating a lasting and sustained culture shift in our society. Stigma is a societal creation which can be described as prejudice and discrimination. Many people recognise stigma as unjust and make it their goal to change it; others may be unaware or unmotivated by the phenomenon altogether. 

Strategies for improving help-seeking by children and young people should focus on improving mental health literacy, reducing stigma and taking into account the desire of young people for self-reliance.

##### Activity 6 Wellbeing bingo 

**All individuals’ experience of school and mental health are specific to them, with no two experiences being the same. Through this activity participants should start to develop their awareness that personal experiences are affected by issues such as family, staff and environment. This activity highlights the diversity in a group.** 

**Aims** 

- To continue to develop communication skills through     positive enquiry 

- To encourage students to communicate with everyone     within the group 

- To demonstrate that we all have mental health and that     a variety of factors impact on this 

**Step 1: Introduction** Before beginning the activity remind participants of the importance of keeping themselves safe. Make reference to Activity 1 and the group contract. 

**Step 2: Completing the statements** The task is to search and find an individual in the group that can honestly complete the statements on the bingo sheet. The facilitator should encourage all participants to be respectful to others through the activity and read out all the bingo card squares. 

- Each statement must be signed by only one person from     the group 

- The individual must sign their name against the     statement that applies to them on the answer card 

- Each statement must be signed by a different individual     from the group 

- You may sign your own sheet once 

- Once your answer card is full shout 'bingo!' and the     facilitator will check answers

##### Activity 7 Understanding stigma 

**Many people with mental health conditions say that the stigma that surrounds mental health is harder to live with than the condition itself. Stigma results in discriminatory or negative behaviour and treatment towards people and the fear of stigma often prevents people from seeking help and treatment.** 

Stigma is frequently perpetuated through mistaken beliefs about mental health, and can be seen in people’s attitudes, in public policy, in the media, etc. We can all work together to reduce stigma by providing accurate information about mental health conditions and their treatment. 

**Aims** 

- To demonstrate how stigma acts as a barrier to people     seeking help for mental health problems and mental     health conditions 

- To show that people’s attitudes about mental health     can be positively influenced by exposure to     accurate information 

- To explore the meaning of the term stigma and     the relationship between attitudes (beliefs) and     discriminatory treatment (behaviour and actions) 

**Step 1: Defining stigma and discrimination Stigma** is about disrespect. It’s the use of negative words to identify a person. It stops people from getting the help they need due to the fear of being discriminated against. **Discrimination** is the unfair treatment of one person or a group of people. 

- Split the students up into groups and ask if they     know what the word ‘stigma’ means and write this on     a flipchart 

- Bring the groups back together and lead the discussion     of the definition of stigma, and the relationship between     stigma, stereotyping and discrimination

Here are some questions that will help you to guide the conversation. Encourage students to share language they have heard others using – they don’t have to agree with the statements. 

- What are some of the negative things you have heard     about people with mental health conditions?     (Responses may include: Violent; crazy) 

- Why do you think people with mental health conditions     are stigmatised? (Possible answers include: They are     weird/different; people don’t really know the facts) 

- Can you think of any other health conditions or social     issues that have been stigmatised throughout history?     (Possible answers include: Homosexuality; HIV; divorce) 

- What kinds of factors have contributed to changing     public attitudes around some of these conditions     or issues? (Possible answers include: Education;     research; legislation) 

- What do you think influences perceptions about mental     health? (Possible answers include: The media – films,     news, newspaper headlines and stories that associate     people with violence) 

- How do you think stigma affects the lives of people with     mental health conditions? (Possible answers include:     People decide not to get help and treatment even though     they could benefit from it; it makes them unhappy; they     may not be able to get a job or find housing) 

**Step 2: Review** 

- Are participants surprised how different issues have     been stigmatised throughout history? 

- Has this made participants think differently about any of     the attitudes they have or language they use? **minutes**

##### Activity 8 Facts continuum 

**In this session young people will be able to explore and challenge their own and others’ values and attitudes through the discussion of facts about mental health.** 

Before beginning the activity remind participants of the importance of keeping themselves safe. Make reference to Activity 1 and the group contract. If there are physical constraints within the space where you are working it may be easier to adapt this session using another method for young people to express their view – such as with coloured paddles or whiteboards. 

**Aims** 

- To challenge the stigma that acts as a barrier to seeking     help for mental health problems 

- To positively influence individual attitudes through     exposure to accurate information 

**Step 1: Expressing and challenging views** 

- The facilitator should put up the signs – ‘agree’, ‘disagree’     and ‘unsure’ 

- The facilitator will read from a series of statements, e.g.     ‘People with mental health problems don’t get better’ 

- Participants choose to publicly identify with the     statement and stand by the sign that indicates their     response – the facilitator should make it clear to the     students that it's okay if they feel they don't know the     correct answer 

- Facilitator to generate discussion amongst the group     if there are differences in where/how individuals     stood/responded 

Start the categories at a relatively low level of discomfort and increase according to the nature of the group. Participants should know this activity is not a lie-detector test – they choose to answer.

**Aims** 

- To provide an icebreaker that encourages students to     participate in an open discussion 

- To demonstrate that everyone has mental health 

- To demonstrate that mental health like physical health     can be effectively treated 

**Step 1: Part one**

- This exercise is all about opening up a discussion 

- Tell participants that they don’t have to agree with or     believe in the ideas or names they offer/say 

- Give each group a piece of flip chart paper with one/two     of four terms written at the top: **Physical health** / **Mental**     **health** / **Physical illness** / **Mental illness** 

- Give the groups five minutes to ‘thought shower’ all the     words that come to mind when they see the term 

- After five minutes, ask groups to tape their sheets up on     a wall for all groups to see 

- Ask one student from each group to read out their list for     the whole class 

- Ask students what they notice about the type of words     used on each sheet 

- Discuss the similarities and differences in student     responses to mental and physical aspects of people’s health 

- Ask students to suggest some reasons for these     differences

##### Activity 10 Zombie apocalypse 

**This activity is designed to challenge students' preconceptions of mental health and areas of intersectionality (e.g. age, gender, sexuality) in a controlled environment through role play.** 

Before starting the activity the facilitator should consider potential triggers and issues that may come up and whether it is appropriate for all participants to take part – revisit the group contract and enable participants to opt out if they feel it is necessary. The facilitator should also ensure that the signposting info in this pack is made available to all participants after the activity. 

Any participants who choose not to take part can assume the role of an ‘observer’ and consider any learning points for the group. 

This activity can be run alternatively as a paper exercise for quieter groups who may be uncomfortable taking part in role play. There are 12 characters; in a classroom situation the students could be split into two groups running the activity simultaneously or for younger groups the students can team up into pairs or threes with each taking a character between them. 

**Aims** To understand that: 

- Everyone has mental health and can experience distress     regardless of whether or not they have mental health     problems/conditions 

- Everyone is unique 

- We all have factors that influence how we think and feel     about ourselves 

- Mental health conditions like physical health conditions     can be effectively treated

**Step 1: Introduction** 

- Let the group read the brief... 

 Brief: A zombie apocalypse has happened in Scotland The government and emergency services no longer exist. Young people were identified as a priority group to be taken to a ‘safe zone’ on the Isle of Skye. However the bus you were traveling on has broken down just north of Fort William. 

 In 25 minutes a huge herd of zombies is due to pass your location. You and your group have found a shelter that will protect some of you from the herd. It also has medical supplies, fresh water and food. Unfortunately after closer inspection, the shelter only has room for 6 people. This means that only 6 people can survive and continue on to the ‘safe zone’ once the herd has passed. 

 ...and then hand out the first set of character details (one card per person). It is up to the facilitator, which individual will get which character description. 

- The group now has 25 minutes to decide amongst     themselves who is to stay and who is to leave the shelter.     This could be purely discussion based within the group or     the facilitator could choose to get the participants to role     play the character they have the card for. 

- After the group has made its decision (or 15 minutes is     up), give each person their second character description.     The group then has 10 more minutes to make their final     decision on who should stay in the shelter. 

Note: If the participants struggle to complete the task with 5 minutes remaining, the facilitator can introduce the suggestion of removing the supplies from the shelter. This will provide space for 4 more people in the shelter. 

**Step 2: Review** 

- Now ask the group to discuss how they came to the final     decision. Did they change their choices? Yes/No – Why? 

- How does this scenario reflect real life situations? 

- Stigma/discrimination/stereotyping/making     assumptions based upon what people look like, how     they speak, where they come from and what they do. 

- Is there anything else you can learn/take away from     this activity?

##### Activity 11 Fact versus fiction 

**Often the way we react to a situation is based on our personal interpretation of the events. We can’t change facts but we can change our interpretations of stories, to be more positive and support us to act in a way that’s less stigmatising. Think back to the iceberg theory.** 

**Aims** 

- To explore the difference between facts and     interpretations and to understand the impact     interpretations have on the decisions that people make 

- To consider how a common language could be used to     challenge mental health stigma and discrimination and     help young people speak out

**Step 1: Part one introduction** The facilitator should demonstrate (role play) one of the examples below as a tableau (a single/group of models or motionless figures representing a scene from a story or from history) or if more appropriate distribute the flash cards of tableaus. 

**Example one:** _Head in hands: e.g. crying, migraine, lost somebody close, disengaged. Facilitator/participant to suddenly sit with their elbows on their knees with their face covered, resting in their hands._ 

**Example two:** _Two People and a Bag: e.g. It’s a theft A stole B’s bag, B is going to beat up A... The facilitator stands one foot in front of the other carrying a bag and looking back anxiously. The participant stands five paces or so behind, one foot in front of the other but wider apart and the arms up as if running._ 

Ask the group what they see and record all the answers on a flipchart: 

- After you have a full flipchart of responses circle any that     are fact and ask again, what can you actually see? What     are the facts? 

- Circle all the suggestions that are facts and ask the group     if those are facts then what are the rest of the words?     Answer: Assumptions, stories or interpretations. 

- What were most easy to come up with, facts     or interpretations? 

- Interpretation = anything that can be disputed. 

**Step 2: Review** What are conflicts most likely to be caused by? Can you think of anything you will take away from this to deal with situations differently in the future? 

Interpretations aren’t bad – we all interpret things to make sense of the world around us and keep ourselves safe. However, if we separate the fact from the story or interpretation it opens up the possibility of clear communication.

**Step 3: Part two introduction** Facilitator to ask participants to reflect on their experiences in education and come up with an example when they’ve acted on interpretations or stories rather than facts or times they have had this happen to them. Reference could be made to the use of written communication, such as texts on social media, how they don’t convey tone and are often misinterpreted by others. 

Ask the participants to get into pairs – Person A and Person B 

- Person A is to tell Person B about a time that they/     someone acted on their interpretations and they were less     than happy with the outcome. Person B listens without     interrupting (2 minutes) 

- After two minutes Person B gets to summarise back and     ends by asking what they would have rather had happen     (1 minute) 

- Person A and B then swap roles and repeat the process 

**F.I.D.O example** 

 Fact (What actually happened) 

 Another student pushed past me Fiction (Interpretation) (The story you told yourself) 

 She’s rude, I should tell her she’s out of order Decision (What you did based on your interpretation) 

 I felt annoyed and so mumbled “stupid cow” under my breath Outcome (The consequences of your decision) 

 She looked scared, I felt embarrassed as others were watching 

Ask participants to come up with different interpretations, which may result in a different decision and therefore a different outcome. E.g. 

 Fact (What actually happened) 

 Another student pushed past me Fiction (Interpretation) (The story you told yourself) 

 She didn’t see me – she’s in a hurry for something or upset Decision (What you did based on your interpretation) 

 I asked if she was okay, and said it was fine for her to go before me Outcome (The consequences of your decision) 

 She had some choice, I felt less embarrassed and more empowered

**Step 4: Review** 

- How was it to have someone listen to your F.I.D.O.     scenario and feedback? 

- What are the benefits of separating out the Facts of what     happens from our Interpretation? 

- What can it create for us in challenging situations? 

- How could this idea be used to end mental health stigma     and discrimination? 

- Could you change the decisions you make by being     aware of how interpretations affect them?

##### Activity 12 Rights survey 

**Rights are essential to ensuring that everyone has equal opportunity and the chance to succeed in life free from discrimination. Children's rights are a list of promises to children and young people to keep them safe. They are used to make sure you are treated fairly and looked after properly.** 

**Aims** 

- To get students to explore human rights on a     personal level 

- To give students an understanding of the fundamental     importance and value of human rights 

- To explore mental health in a rights-based context 

**Step 1: Introduction** The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone document in the history of human rights. Drafted by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, the Declaration was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on 10 December 1948. It sets out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be universally protected. When something is a ‘right’, it means that nobody can take it away from you. It is yours, and is meant to protect you and help you have a good life. 

- Now take the time to read the wider context in Scotland     information to the participants 

- Facilitator to discuss background and context of rights     with participants

**Step 2: My rights** 

- Facilitator to discuss background and context of rights     with participants 

- Give each participant a copy of the human rights     worksheet 

- Scenario – Participants have been given a list of some     basic human rights. Due to new legislation everyone is     about to lose six rights. Before any decisions are made     about which rights these will be, the government is     carrying out research to find out which rights are most     important to people and what impact losing these might     have on their lives 

- Read out the ‘rights’ to participants and explain any     points if needed 

- Instruct participants to choose six rights that they would     definitely not want to lose 

- Now ask participants to consider: How might your life     be affected over the next three years if you lose these     rights? Write down some of the changes that might     happen to you and in your life 

- You can additionally tally the participants' top answers     to generate discussion and debate. Was there a general     consensus on what rights were more important? What     would it feel like to live in a world where you only had the     six rights you chose? 

**Step 3: Review and discussion** Was it harder to give up rights than you thought it would be? Which right was it harder to give up? 

Further information on children’s rights can be found at Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland **[http://www.cypcs.org.uk](http://www.cypcs.org.uk)** This site is for children and young people in Scotland, their parents and the adults who work with them. Rights for Life **(rightsforlife.org)** is a statement of the rights that people affected by mental health conditions in Scotland are calling for.

**Wider context in Scotland** 

**Women’s rights and suffragettes:** Traditionally, prior to World War I, women were kept out of public life, and the roles of married women were confined to the domestic sphere. Suffragists simply wanted votes for women on the same terms as men. Much change in Scotland came about through the war effort: women could prove their worth by joining the Women’s Land Army or Voluntary Aid Detachments. 

In 1915 landlords increased rents around the shipyards and munitions plants. The Govan and Partick women organised resistance and as a result of the ‘women’s fight’, the Rent Restriction Act froze rents. Women had at last broken a social barrier. 

By 1918 the Representation of the People Act changed the voting system. Women over 30 and men over 21 were given the vote, and women were for the first time allowed to stand for Parliament. Many counties reduced their voting ages to 18 during the 1970s, starting with the United Kingdom with the Representation of the People Act 1969. 

**Votes at 16:** Scottish Parliament voted unanimously on 27 October 2007 for a policy of reducing the voting age to 16, as well as in favour of a campaign for the necessary power to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The voting age in Scotland has been lowered to include 16and 17-yearolds after new electoral powers were introduced for the Scottish Parliament. Scottish ministers were given powers to set a separate voting age and franchise for elections to Holyrood and for Scotland’s 32 local authorities. 

**LGBT rights in Scotland:** Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) rights in Scotland are generally regarded one of the most progressive in Europe. In 2015, Scotland was recognised as the ‘best country in Europe for LGBTI legal equality’. 

Previously however Section 28 an amendment of the Local Government Act 1988 enacted on 24 May 1988, stated that a local authority “shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality” or “promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”. It was repealed on 


21 June 2000 in Scotland as one of the first pieces of legislation enacted by the new Scottish Parliament. 

Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in Scotland since 1980 and the age of consent has been equal to that for opposite-sex activity since 2001. Same-sex marriage was approved by Scottish Parliament in February 2014 with civil partnerships having been legal since 2005. Same-sex couples have also been granted joint and step adoption since 2009 and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity have been banned since 2005. 

**Children’s rights:** The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (commonly abbreviated UNCRC) is a human rights treaty which sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children. The Convention defines a child as any human being under the age of eighteen. 

Nations that ratify this convention are bound to it by international law. Compliance is monitored by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which is composed of members from countries around the world. The UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on 20 November 1989 (the 30th anniversary of its Declaration of the Rights of the Child). It came into force on 2 September 1990, after it was ratified by the required number of nations. Currently, 196 countries are party to it, including every member of the United Nations except the United States. 


##### Activity 12 Rights worksheet 

You have been given a list of some basic human rights. Due to new legislation everyone is about to lose six rights. Before any decisions are made about which rights these will be, the government is carrying out research to find out which rights are most important to people and what impact losing these might have on their lives. 

 Rights: The right to... Give my permission before people do things for me 

 Have a drink with a friend 

 Go to bed whenever I want to 

 Read whatever I want when I want provided it is legal Look for a job An education Go to a night class Have a consensual relationship 

 Have a private life Use public transport 

 Have children Do my own shopping 

 Choose where to live 

 Choose my own clothes 

 Be listened to Be included in medical decisions that affect me Legal redress when I experience discrimination 

 Make my own decisions about who and if I marry 

 Express my opinion and have it valued 

 Be on my own when I want 

 Say YES and NO whenever I want to 

 Make decisions regarding my own welfare 

 Make decisions regarding my family and children’s welfare 

**Section 1:** From the table choose six rights that you definitely would not want to lose and list them here: **1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.** 

**Section 2:** Consider how your life might be affected over the next three years if you lose these rights. Write down some of the changes that might happen to you and in your life.

##### Activity 13 Discussion groups 

**Stigma frequently acts as a barrier to people seeking help for mental health problems and mental health conditions. By providing factual information about these conditions participants can be supported to positively challenge negative and inaccurate attitudes about mental health.** 

**Aims** 

- To provide information about common mental health     conditions 

- To have participants learn about these conditions and     share their learning with others 

**Step 1: Introduction** Before beginning the activity remind participants of the importance of keeping themselves safe. Make reference to Activity 1 and the group contract. 

Encourage participants to share language they have heard others using – they don’t have to agree with the statements. 

**Step 2: Research** 

- Explain to participants that they will work in small groups     and will research one mental health condition using the     factsheets provided in the appendix 

- Depression 

- Anxiety 

- OCD 

- Psychosis 

- Self-harm 

- Bipolar Disorder 

- Suicide 

- Panic Disorders 

- Personality Disorders

##### Activity 13 Discussion group worksheet 

Example: **Diagnosis:** Depression **Associated stigma:** People choose to be depressed, they need to ‘snap out’ of it, they are just lazy, they are trying to get attention. 

**Reason for stigma?** It is often portrayed as a phase that people grow out of and it is frequently dramatised in TV shows as something trivial or ‘teen angst’ and so it is often dismissed e.g. 'young people don’t have anything to be depressed about'. 

**What is it really?** People do not choose to be depressed. Depression is developed over time and requires appropriate treatment to deal with the psychiatric symptoms and underlying issues. Depression is a term used to describe a state of low mood. Clinical Depression is a mental health condition. This can be confusing because people may often feel depressed but will not have Clinical Depression. People with Clinical Depression could feel sad or irritable and also experience lack of interest, a sense of hopelessness, sleep problems and loss of appetite, which can all have a negative impact on a person’s life.

##### Activity 14 Coping, resilience and 

##### managing stress 

**The different situations you will be experiencing throughout your life may cause you worry, anxiety or stress. This is due to you experiencing new and different situations that challenge you mentally and physically. These helpful points will enable you to deal with stressful situations.** 

**Aims** 

- To help enable participants to recognise and deal with     stressful situations 

**Step 1: Introduction** Before beginning the activity remind participants of the importance of keeping themselves safe. Make reference to Activity 1 and the group contract. Make it clear to the participants that everyone copes differently with stress and as such everyone will have their own way of dealing with things. 

**Step 2: Managing stress** 

- Facilitator to discuss background and context of stress     using the information provided 

- Do participants know what stress, coping and resilience     are? Use the definitions provided to direct discussion 

- Give each participant a copy of the participant worksheet.     This can be discussed in pairs or small groups. 

- Instruct participants to complete the participant     worksheet – they can keep the worksheet 

**Step 3: Review** 

- Ask participants how they found the activity? 

- Why do they think it’s important? 

- Were they surprised by anything? 

- Will participants try to use these in future?

**Stress defined** – Physiological or biological stress is our response to a stressor such as an environmental condition. Stress is a body’s method of reacting to a challenge. Stress typically describes a negative condition or a positive condition that can have an impact on a person’s mental and physical well-being. 

**Coping defined** – Coping is expending conscious effort to solve personal and interpersonal problems, and seeking to master, minimise or tolerate stress or conflict. The effectiveness of the coping efforts depends on the type of stress and/or conflict, the particular individual, and the circumstances. Positive coping strategies include spending time with friends, doing exercise, keeping a diary and talking about your problems. Negative coping strategies can cause you harm and include things like drugs, alcohol and hurting yourself. 

**Resilience defined** – Resilience is defined as an individual’s ability to properly adapt to stress and adversity. Stress and adversity can come in the shape of family or relationship problems, health problems, bullying, problems at school or workplace and financial worries, among others. Resilience is not a rare ability; in reality, it is found in the average individual and it can be learned and developed by virtually anyone. Resilience should be considered a process, rather than a trait to be obtained. 

**Why is relaxation helpful?** When we are stressed, the muscles in our bodies tense up and this muscular tension causes uncomfortable bodily feelings, such as headache, backache, tight chest and so on. These aches and pains of tension can cause mental worry, making us even more anxious and tense. People who are tense often feel tired. Relaxing slows down the systems in the body that speed up when we get anxious. If we can learn to turn on the bodily symptoms of relaxation we can turn off the symptoms of tension. They are two sides of the same coin: You can’t experience feelings of relaxation and tension at the same time. 


**Everyday life** The ability to relax is not always something that comes naturally; it is a skill that has to be learnt like playing the piano. 

- Stop rushing around – you achieve more by doing     things calmly 

- Give yourself short breaks – relax, stretch, go for a walk 

- Adopt a relaxed posture. Deliberately relax if you notice     yourself tensing up. Drop your shoulders, sit back in your     chair, and unclench your fists. 

**When experiencing stress** 

- Do not withdraw from social support 

- Keep communicating – ventilate your feelings 

- Keep areas and times for relaxation 

- Do not expect too much of yourself 

- Do not feel that you have to live up to others’     expectations of you 

- Think twice about how important tasks are.     Try saying ‘No’ 

- Break your goals into manageable proportions 

- Think positively about your abilities 

**Stress release exercises Hands and arms** – Clench your fits, and tense your arms; feel tightness in your hands and arms, hold for 5 seconds then slowly relax them. Release and relax each muscle group for 10 to 15 seconds. See how far they will go, but do not push. Do not hold on at all; let everything go. **Breath** – Slow and steady, let yourself relax each time you breathe out. **Shoulders** – Hunch your shoulders, and then gradually let them settle down **Forehead** – Pull your eyebrows together, then gradually let your forehead smooth out. **Jaw** – Bite your back teeth together, then gradually ease off, and let your jaw get heavy. **Neck** – Pull your chin forward on to your chest, feel tightness, then relax. **Tummy** – Pull in your tummy tight, then gradually let it go, feeling it relax. **Thighs** – Push your heels down hard against the floor, feeling the tightness in your thighs, and then gradually let that go. **Calves** – Point your toes, then gradually let that tightness go. 



##### Activity 14 Coping, resilience and managing stress worksheet 

When in stressful situations the following exercise may help you to deal with confusing or upsetting conditions. Most people are not mind readers, and so if you are upset about how someone/a situation is acting/progressing, you need to remember that. For example remember a time in your life when you got into a fight/argument with someone, and it was all a misunderstanding, or because you had different points of view. 

Is this such a problem? Do people around the world all have to think the same? Of course not! So why do so many arguments happen? Normally because of communication breakdowns. It helps a great deal in a situation when you know what someone else is feeling, or where they are coming from. 

Use the following technique to help when a strained situation arises. 

**Stress management** 

 How I normally deal with 'stress' can include (circle the ones you do): Shouting Fighting Going away from the situation 

 Taking time out Arguing Listening 

 Swearing Listening to music Getting more people involved 

**Try and answer the following questions:** When I am stressed it feels like... 

I can tell when I am getting stressed because... 

I normally handle stressful situations by... 

How can I tell when a situation is becoming stressful? 

How can I better deal with 'stressful' situations? 

I cope by... 

I get support from... 


**Responding to difficult situations:** Take these steps, to explain to the person what’s going on in your head, and see if it makes the situation different: When you... ( _Whatever they have just done/said_ ) 

I feel... ( _Whatever you have felt about what has happened_ ) 

And I think that... ( _Whatever you thought was going on/happening/going to happen_ ) 

And in the future, what I would like to happen is... ( _Let them know what you would like to happen_ ) 

This technique, can be used, and applied in different situations in all areas of your life. It’s good to learn, and practice at different times.

 Situation and help cards (Available in appendix) 

##### Activity 15 Help and support 

**Young people have wide and varied experiences and some experiences require support. However, some people may have difficulties in identifying where to go and/or lack the confidence to access help.** 

You will find a list of good sources to signpost participants onto toward the end of this pack; all of these have been highlighted by young people as good sources of support or information. 

**Aims** 

- To consider personal coping strategies 

- To explore some of the issues faced by young people 

- To consider the services that can be accessed to get help     and support 

- To affirm to young people that it is okay to seek help 

**Step 1: Introduction** 

- Remember and remind participants about the group     contract and staying safe 

- Split the participants up into smaller groups for discussion 

- Facilitator to read aloud and ask participants to consider     the following scenarios 

- Taking a big exam 

- Dealing with family breakdown 

- Dealing with the death of someone close 

- How would students cope in these situations? 

- Could they cope alone or would they ultimately need help? 

**Step 2: Who can help** The situation cards reflect the reality of what is happening in the lives of many young people but some may evoke strong reactions. It is therefore important to choose those which are age appropriate to the group and consider potential triggers. Remember how embarrassing it can be to talk about difficult issues no matter what age you are and help the young people develop empathic responses. 

- Divide participants into small groups (no more than 6) 

- Give each group a set of situation cards and where to get     help cards and ask them to place the situation cards face     down on the floor

- Ask participants to spread the where to get help cards in     a circle 

- Ask participants one at a time to choose a situation card     and decide if they were in the situation which source     they would use from the where to get help cards, if any 

- Ask participants to try and get group consensus about     their choice of source – would all group members use     that source? 

- When they have agreed on a source ask them to place     their where to get help card on that source, facing into     the middle of the circle. If they cannot find a source they     would use they must place the situation card outside     the circle 

- When all the groups have completed the task ask them     to move around the room and examine each other’s     work. Ask them to compare similarities and differences     in where they have placed the situation cards 

**Step 3: Review** 

- Why did they choose one source rather than another?     How would they access/find the source? 

- What issues would they be concerned about most?     Ask them to focus on the cards outside the circle and     consider what support and help these young people     might need. What helps young people to use support     and health services?

##### Activity 16 Showing support and 

##### tracking issues 

**This activity is designed to enable students to reflect on the previous activities and express support for someone experiencing distress or concerns about their mental health.** 

Young people often find it difficult to raise concerns and issues in front of their peer group. These activities allow participants to reflect on what they have learnt throughout the pack and action areas for change and development. 

**Aims** 

- To enable participants to openly consider and articulate     what support they could provide 

- To allow participants to anonymously address areas of     mental health stigma and discrimination they see 

- To enable the participants to actively consider ways that     mental health stigma and discrimination could be tackled 

- To enable adults to track issues and areas of concern 

**Step 1: Part 1 – Showing support** 

- Come up with a sample statement that reflects a mental     health issue (or use one of the sample statements     provided below) 

- Write the statement on a large strip of paper and stick it     to a blank wall 

- Make participants aware of the wall and provide them     with a ‘brick’ (post-it note) each 

- Ask participants to work together or alone and come up     with one or more comments to support the statement     on the wall; they should write these on their ‘brick’ and     stick it to the wall or hand it in to be put up 

- Collect the comments (bricks) and attach them on the     wall under the sample statement or if already displayed     take a photo and share your wall of support with See Me 

- This activity can be repeated with different statements or     age groups

**Sample statements:** 

- I don’t know who to talk to about how I’m feeling 

- I don’t tell my friends everything, I worry what they will     think of me 

- It feels like there is no point and nobody understands me 

- I feel like I can’t cope 

**Step 2: Tracking issues** 

- Facilitator to distribute ‘issue boxes’ in key areas     e.g. where young people are aware of them and     in open areas 

- Facilitator to give out ‘issue’ cards to participants 

- Ask participants to consider what they have learnt     throughout the activities and inform them about the     ‘issue boxes’ 

- Let students put their ‘issues’ in the ‘See Me’ box.     This way issues can be tracked and addressed 

- Collect these at regular intervals and compile to track     issues or areas of concern 

- This activity can be repeated several times across a year.     Key times would be those that are particularly stressful     for young people e.g. prior to exams
