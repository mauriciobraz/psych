# Lesson #1: Learning the Facts 

Objectives: (1) Students will understand key characteristics of mental illness. (2) Students will be able to define stigma. 

Time: 30 40 minutes 

Materials: Small whiteboards with markers for each team Internet connection and projector WalkinOurShoes.org "What is Mental Health" section 

## ENGAGE 

Ask students "how many of you have been sick in the last year?" How were you sick? How long were you sick? Take 3 5 responses. Reinforce that students (1) are describing physical symptoms (headache, fever, chills, upset stomach, etc.); (2) sought help from a doctor; (3) took medicine; and (4) recovered. 

DO/EXPERIENCE (1) Explain that today we are going to learn about mental health and mental illness. Explain that just like being physically ill, persons with a mental illness have symptoms, can seek help, may take medicine, and can recover. 

(2) Divide the class into teams comprised of 3 4 participants. Tell the class that you will be reading information about mental health and mental illness from the WalkinOurShoes website and then asking teams to respond to questions about what you read. The team who answers the most questions correctly will be the winner. (You may want to have a small prize for the winning team.) 

Give each team a whiteboard and marker to use display answers to the game questions. Each team will write on their whiteboard what they think is the correct answer. Points are awarded for each correct answer. Some rounds may be worth extra points to keep the game interesting. 

(3) Read the What is Mental Health? section of the WalkinOurShoes website. 

After reading the text, have teams respond to the following questions: 


1) Being healthy includes a. having a body that feels good and works well b. having a healthy mind and body c. not being sick d. all of the above (Note to teacher: the emphasis is on physical and mental health both being important to overall health. Being healthy includes more than just the physical. Wellness is more than the absence of illness.) 

2) Mental illness can occur only after a person has reached adulthood. a. True b. False 

(Note to teacher: All kinds of people can experience mental illness, including children.) 

3) Having a mental illness can affect the way that a person a. behaves b. thinks c. feels d. all of the above 

(Note to teacher: Explain that some people feel depressed or anxious, some have scrambled thoughts and have a hard time thinking clearly, and others act out or are afraid to act at all. Explain that there are different kinds of mental illnesses and in subsequent lessons we will be learning more about these different types.) 

4) If a person who is physically sick goes to see a medical doctor, a person who has a mental health problem sees a ________________? 

(Note to teacher: Accept any of the following answers: mental health professional, counselor, therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. You may also explain that someone may initially see their medical doctor who may help with a referral to a mental health professional). 

5) What causes mental illness? a. diet b. catching it from someone else c. being violent 


 d. no one knows 

(Note to teacher: Researchers generally think mental illness results from a mix of what's going on in your body and what's happening around you. Some people may have a certain predisposition or tendency for a certain illness, yet also need to have certain things happening in their environment for the illness to develop). 6) Another way to talk about mental illness is to say a. mental health challenge b. mental wellness c. mental malfunction d. disordered mentality 

(Note to teacher: Part of what we want to convey to young people is the notion that mental illness is a part of life. It is a challenge. Some do refer to a mental illness as a mental disorder, but disordered mentality is not a correct answer). 

7) What does the term "diagnosis" mean? a. to have a feeling that you know what is wrong b. to meet with your medical doctor who gives you a prescription for medication c. to meet with a mental health professional and he or she gives what you are experiencing a name d. to be told you have a mental illness e. all of the above 

(Note to teacher: A mental health professional will be able to tell if someone has a mental illness based on the person's feelings, how often the person has them, and how they affect the person's life. If a mental health professional thinks a person has a mental illness, he or she will give what the person is experiencing a name, such as depression or anxiety, and this is called a diagnosis.) 

8) What is the least effective way of dealing with a mental health challenge or mental illness? a. keeping feelings bottled up inside b. telling a trusted adult how you feel c. staying at a hospital for a brief period of time d. meeting with a mental health professional 

(Note to teacher: Seeking help is to be encouraged. Some young people may worry about how they think, feel or behave and wonder if they could have a mental illness. Encouraging them to 


share how they feel with a trusted adult or to seek help from a mental health professional is a good way to alleviate or lessen their anxiety). 

9) If a person with a mental illness or mental health challenge experiences "stigma", what does that mean? 

(Note to teacher: Generally we want students to get the idea that stigma means labeling someone in a negative way because they may be different than you. Accept any of the following answers: labeling someone in a negative way; saying bad things about a person; believing things about a person that aren't true and then making fun of the person; making someone feel different or picking on someone because they aren't like you; calling someone names like "crazy"). 

10) People with a mental illness will always be ill. a. True b. False 

(Note to teacher: With help and support from family, friends and mental health professionals, people with a mental illness can recover and lead productive, fulfilling lives). 

At the end of the game, sum up points and indicate which team won. 

REFLECT Who can tell me one thing they learned today about mental illness that they did not know before this class began? 

APPLY Explore with students how they might act in the following situations, helping them see how they might apply the knowledge from today's lesson: 

- What would you do if you found out your friend had been diagnosed with a mental     illness? 

- What would you do if you witnessed someone at school making fun of a person with a     mental illness? 

(Note to Teacher: Students are apt to answer with responses they think that you may want to hear. Challenge them to consider what they really would or would not do and why doing the "right" thing might not always be so easy. Accept all answers, even those that suggest actions 


that are not consistent with acceptance of another person. If this happens, probe deeper to find out why someone would ignore in incident where a classmate was the victim of bullying or not want to be with a friend who has been diagnosed with a mental illness. Ask students if in fact there response has to do with stigma. Find out what it would take for those who are hesitant to change their behavior). 


# Lesson #2: You Have to Learn It to Teach It 

Objectives: Students will understand that there are different types of mental illnesses. 

Time: 40 minutes 

Materials: Large chart paper Markers Tape Scissors Descriptions of mental health challenges from the WalkinOurShoes website Walkinourshoes.org "What is Mental Health" section 9 envelopes Preparation Before introducing the activity, print out the content on the Walkinourshoes website under the "Mental Health Challenges" tab. Cut out the descriptions of each of the mental health challenges (ADHD, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bi-Polar Disorder, Depression, Eating Disorders, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Schizophrenia) and place each description in a separate envelope. 

Before beginning the Do/Experience section of the lesson, create 9 different workstations using 9 sheets of large chart paper taped to the wall. Number each station 1-9. 

## ENGAGE 

Write on the board the following: 

- ADHD 

- Anxiety 

- Autism Spectrum Disorder 

- Bi-Polar Disorder 

- Depression 

- Eating Disorders 

- Post Traumatic Stress Disorder 

- Schizophrenia 

Reading item-by-item, asking the class if anyone knows what each term means? Let the students know that today's lesson is going to focus on learning something about each of these mental health challenges. 


(Note to teacher: You might indicate to the students that they might know someone who has experienced one of these challenges, but remind them that this is not about telling someone else's story, but more about just understanding what each term is about.) 

DO/EXPERIENCE (1) Divide the group by numbering each student 1 through 9. Have each student go to the workstation that has his or her number. "All the ones to the one station, etc.” 

(2) Hand out one envelope containing one of the 9 mental health challenges to each group. 

(3) Instruct the groups to read the paragraph and put the name of their mental health challenge at the top of their chart paper. Using the content in their paragraph, each group should create 4 5 bullets or short sentences that describe the mental health challenge assigned to their group. Let the groups know that their list should also include some positive aspect related to the challenge. (See note to Teacher regarding take away messages under the Reflect section). 

(4) Give each group 2-3 minutes to present to the other groups what they have learned about their group's mental health challenge. 

(5) When the groups are ready, have each group present on their topic. 

(Note to teacher: Before the presentations tell students that you want them to listen not only for the details that distinguish one mental health challenge from the other, but that you also want them to listen for what can be something positive about such challenges (see note to teacher under Reflect section). As groups present, circle the bulleted content that has the positive statement so that it is more visible and later when summarizing students can visually see what may be a positive commonality across all challenges -e.g. people can be helped... people still want friends, etc. Teachers may have to help the groups identify what is a positive). 

## REFLECT 

Who can tell me one thing they learned today about mental health challenges that they did not know before this class began? 


Ask students to look at the positive characteristics that are circled. Ask, "as we look at the positives that are circled, are there any similarities across the different challenges"? Help student identify these as needed. 

(Note to Teacher: Big take away messages to reinforce with students are: 

- people facing mental health challenges are just like everybody else in that they want to be     a friend and have friends 

- with help people with mental health challenges can get better and live normal lives ) 

APPLY Ask students to select a mental health challenge described here today and tell why it could be difficult to befriend that person. What is it that presents a barrier? How could you get over this barrier or what would it take to get over this barrier? 


# Lesson #3: Myth vs. Fact 

Objectives: (1) Students will be able to distinguish myths from facts related to mental illness 

Time: 30 minutes 

Materials: envelopes for each pair of students one myth and fact sheet per student, with myths and facts cut into individual pieces and placed in the envelope. Each student pair will have an envelope that contains 12 myths and 12 facts Internet access to the walkinourshoes.org website + projector 

Preparation Before introducing the activity, use the myth/fact sheet at the end of this lesson to prepare the envelopes for students. 

## ENGAGE 

Ask the students Who can tell me in their own words what a fact is? Can someone else share what a myth is? 

(Note to teacher: A fact is a concept whose truth can be proved. For example, it is a fact that there are x number of boys and x number of girls in this classroom. 

A myth is a traditional story often accepted as a fact even though it is not. For example, it is a myth that boys with blonde hair are better students than boys with brown hair. 

## DO/EXPERIENCE 

(1) Put students into working pairs. 

(2) Give each pair an envelope with the 24 myths and fact cutouts. 

(3) Instruct the students to take all 24 cutouts and together decide which ones are myths and which ones are facts. Let them know this is not a test. 


(4) Tell them to put all the myths in a column on the left of their desk and all the facts in a column on the right side of their desk. 

(5) Give students 10 15 minutes to complete the task. 

(6) After students have completed the task, go to [http://walkinourshoes.org/myths-vs-facts](http://walkinourshoes.org/myths-vs-facts) to review the answers to the assignment. 

(7) Review each myth and fact. 

REFLECT Ask the students Who can share with me again what is the difference between a myth and a fact? Why do you think it is important to know the myths and facts about mental illness? How could it be hurtful for people to think that the myths of mental illness are facts? 

(Note to teacher: Some things to emphasize include the more we know the differences about the myths of mental illness and the facts, the better we can help and support the people in our lives who are living with mental illness.) 

APPLY What can you do to make sure that people know the facts of mental illness and not think that the myths are true? 

(Note to teacher: Challenge students about whether they would or would not do the things that they suggest. What are the stumbling blocks? Is stigma a part of their hesitation?) 


# Myths and Facts to Cutout to Place in Envelopes 

myth or fact 

Kids can’t get depression or anxiety, only adults can. 

myth or fact 

Kids can develop a mental illness, like depression and anxiety disorders. This can happen to anyone at any age. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

myth or fact 

Kids only get mental illness because they have bad parents. **_________________________________________________________________________________________________** 

myth or fact 

Mental illness is not caused by doing something wrong. Also, you can’t cause someone to have a mental illness. Doctors think that mental illness is caused by a mix of what’s going on in your body and what’s happening around you. 

myth or fact 

Mental illness is the same as being disabled (sometimes incorrectly called mental retardation). 

myth or fact 

Mental illness has nothing to do with how smart you are. A mental disability is a cognitive disability, which means it’s a different journey with different challenges. It’s still important to treat all people with respect, because you don’t know what life is like in their shoes. 


myth or fact 

Having a mental illness means you’re a wimp who can’t handle life. 

myth or fact 

Your personality or ability to handle your feelings does not cause mental illness. Mental illness is not just “in your head” or something that goes away if you try hard. The right combination of what helps is different for each person. Once they find something that helps them, most people with mental illness live healthy, full lives. 

myth or fact 

People with mental health challenges have to take special tests to get a job or go to college. 

myth or fact 

People with mental health challenges do not have to take special tests to get into college, get a house, or get a job. They can work, learn, and do all the things that people without mental health challenges can do. 

myth or fact 

People with mental illnesses have trouble handling schoolwork, a job, and daily tasks. 

myth or fact 

It is common for all people to sometimes have trouble at school, at home, at jobs and feel sometimes like they don’t know what to do. No matter what, it’s good to talk to others and learn what works best for you. What helps you calm down? What makes you happy and what makes you sad? Knowing these things will help you find a way to do well in school and life. 


myth or fact 

If you have a mental illness, it will be harder to get an apartment or house once you grow up and you won't be able to live on your own. 

myth or fact 

All mental illnesses are different, but being diagnosed with one will not keep you from being able to grow up, learn how to take care of yourself, and get an apartment or house like everyone else. 

myth or fact 

When people have mental illnesses, they will never get better. 

myth or fact 

People diagnosed with mental illnesses can get better. Every illness is different. Some people feel better when they talk to someone, like a friend or a doctor, or take medication. Most people need help from friends and family to talk and figure out how to live with their illness. Not all people have to take medicine or see a therapist for the rest of their lives. 

myth or fact 

Talking about your mental health challenges is a waste of time. It’s better to just take medicine. 


myth or fact 

If you have a broken leg, it will not get better with just aspirin. It also takes time and exercise and hard work. In a way, having a mental illness is the same. You have to be patient, get help, and talk about itand you’ll start to feel better, too. 

myth or fact 

People with mental health illness are dangerous and violent. 

myth or fact 

Most people diagnosed with mental illnesses are not violent. Most violence in the world is not caused by people with mental illnesses. In fact, a person with a mental illness is more likely to be the one who gets hurt or bullied by someone else. 

myth or fact 

Mental illness is more common in some racial groups than others. 

myth or fact 

Mental illness can happen to anyone. It doesn’t matter what you look like, what you wear, or where you come from. 

myth or fact 

I can’t help someone with a mental illness, only a doctor can. 


myth or fact 

You can help someone who has a mental illness. Don’t call people words like “crazy” or “mental.” If you know people with mental health challenges, try to get to know them and notice their talents and skills, not just their illness. Learn about mental wellness and share it with others. If you hear something that isn’t true, don’t be afraid to speak up and talk about what is true. 


# Lesson #4: Checking Ourselves 

Objectives: (1) Students will understand the perspective of a person with mental illness and the hurt that comes from unkind responses. (2) Students will learn about responses that are helpful to someone struggling with a mental health challenge. 

Time: 30 40 minutes 

Materials: List of Slammer Scenarios 

Preparation Print the Slammer Scenarios at the end of this lesson so that each student pair will have a copy. 

## ENGAGE 

Slam the door! Ask the students How many of you have ever slammed a door? How many of you have ever had a door slammed in your face? How did it make you feel? 

(Note to teacher: The emphasis is on how a slammed door makes someone feel left out, not included, angry, etc.) 

## DO/EXPERIENCE 

(1) Divide students into pairs. 

(2) Give each pair the list of "slammer" scenarios. 

(3) Tell the students that just like having a door slammed in your face, words can act as "slammers.” Explain that each of the scenarios has a "slammer.” Their job is to construct helpful responses to take the place of the "slammers.” 

(4) Review the first scenario as a whole group to help students identify the characteristics of what makes a helpful response. Ask students, "What makes this a "slammer?” If we wanted to provide a helpful response, what are some things we could consider that make a response a 


positive one? (Make a list of these characteristics on the board so students can refer to them when working through the other scenarios). Then ask students, how could we change this response to make it a positive one? 

(Note to teacher: some of the things to emphasize about what makes a helpful response include letting the person know you are worried about them, asking how you might help, empathizing with the other person's feelings, refraining from labeling or name calling, suggesting an activity that might help put a more positive spin on the situation). 

(5) Provide time for students to work through the remaining scenarios, writing positive responses instead of "slammers.” 

(6) Review responses with the whole group. 

REFLECT Ask students How was it coming up with something better than a "slammer?” Who found it difficult? Who thought it was easy? 

APPLY Let's suppose you were the person who is anxious in social situations. You feel extremely shy. It's hard for you to meet people, yet you want to be social. How could someone respond in a way that suggested acceptance of you and help you feel more connected in your classroom? What would you tell the person to do or say? 


# Slammer Scenarios 

One friend is stressing out over life and is over-eating to deal with all of the stress. The other friend says “You are so grossing me out, aren't you worried you will get fat!” 

Helpful Response ______________________________________________________________________________ 

One friend has anxiety so bad that she throws up or gets sick to her stomach for no particular reason. The other friend says “You are such a drama queen, everyone knows you are totally faking it.” 

Helpful Response ______________________________________________________________________________ 

One friend has been sad and depressed the last week for no apparent reason. The other friend says “You are being too much of a downer. I don’t think I can hang out with you anymore.” 

Helpful Response ______________________________________________________________________________ 

One friend has been overly happy the last four days and exhibiting some atypical behavior. The other friend says “Stop being such a spaz. You are totally freaking me out!” 

Helpful Response ______________________________________________________________________________ 


One friend is socially awkward and sometimes says things that don’t make sense to the rest of the group. A friend says “You are so weird. You know no one likes you?” 

Helpful Response ______________________________________________________________________________ 

One friend has been having a tough time sitting in class and paying attention. The other friend says “I know this class is boring but you have to stop being such a clown.” 

Helpful Response ______________________________________________________________________________ 


# Lesson #5: Making a Difference 

Objectives: Students will respond in a helpful way to someone struggling with a mental health challenge. 

Time: 30 40 minutes 

Materials: Skits to hand out to each team (see material at the end of the lesson plan) Computer with web access (http://walkinourshoes.org/giving-and-getting-help) Projector 

Preparation Print the Skits at the end of this lesson and cut into separate skits to distribute one per team. 

## ENGAGE 

Review the previous lesson, focusing on what makes a helpful response. 

- Ask students - who remembers what we talked about in our last lesson? 

- Who remembers what some of the things were that we identified about what makes a     helpful response? (letting the person know you are worried about them, asking how the     person feels and how you might help, empathizing with the other person's feelings, just     listening, refraining from labeling or name calling, suggesting an activity that might help     put a more positive spin on the situation, just letting them know you care; and in some     cases sharing your concern and seeking help from a trusted adult). 

- Did anyone try to be helpful since our last lesson? How did it go? 

DO/EXPERIENCE (1) Let the students know that today's lesson is going to focus on practicing helpful responses. Today the class will not just write a response but actually try out how making those responses during role play skits. 

(Note to teacher: Role play is an excellent way to get students to practice new ways of behaving. It can also stimulate silliness or over the top drama. Before dividing the group into smaller acting groups, consider reviewing what makes a good role play. For example: sticking to the point of the role play, not being overly dramatic or silly, treating the topic seriously, having a skit that has a beginning, middle and end, and in this case actually demonstrating what makes a good response.). 


(2) Divide students into role play groups. Provide each group with a skit. Allow 5 10 minutes for the groups to develop their role play. 

(3) Have each group act out their skit. 

(4) After each skit, ask the broader class to identify what the actors did that made the response a helpful one. 

REFLECT When all of the skits are completed, discuss: Did anyone find it difficult to create a skit around helping someone with a mental health challenge? Why? Who found it to be easy? What made it easy? How realistic were these skits? What are the risks involved in making helpful responses? 

(Note to teacher: The intent in identifying "risks" are to get students to reflect on the things they may worry about should they reach out to someone who may be different in some way from their group of friends. These risks could be things such as: being afraid that they might get labeled or teased; that they might not say the right thing; that there other friends might leave them out; that the person they are trying to help might not understand or might rebuff them. After thinking about these risks, ask the students how realistic these risks really are and if the "risks" are too great to "take a chance" on being helpful). 

Go to (http://walkinourshoes.org/giving-and-getting-help) and read the content about Helping Others and Taking Care of Yourself. 

APPLY Say to the students, "quietly, just to yourself, visualize someone you know who could benefit from a helpful, kind response. Think about what that response might look like. Think about when and where you might say something helpful.” 


# Role Play Skits 

Pass out one skit to each team. Some skits may need to be used by more than one group. 

A classmate has just returned back to school after being in the hospital for two weeks to deal with a severe bout of depression. She, or he, is scared to come back to class out of fear that you may stigmatize him/her for his/her mental health challenge. In your skit show how you will welcome your friend back to class. 

A friend in your group is struggling with anorexia (weight loss that occurs from not eating). Friends in the group have noticed this person’s weight loss and are worried about his/her health. Today all of you plan on talking to your friend. Have your skit show what you will say. 

A classmate gets severe panic attacks, especially when a big test is coming up. The teacher has announced that next Friday the class will have a big math and spelling test. You could see your classmate is already becoming worried. Have your skit show how you might help. 

A classmate has been diagnosed with ADHD. He/she struggles with paying attention in class and can’t stay focused for long stretches of time. Your skit should show how you can be helpful. 

A new student arrived at your class last week. You and your friends notice that he/she struggles with making friends. You have also noticed that some kids are starting to pick on him/her. Today you have decided to try to be helpful. Your skit should show what you decided to do. 


# Lesson #6: Matt's Story 

Objectives: Students will understand how one young person deals with his mental illness in a positive way. 

Time: 30 minutes 

Materials: Computer with web access [http://walkinourshoes.org/our-stories/matt](http://walkinourshoes.org/our-stories/matt) and speakers Projector 

## ENGAGE 

Let students know that today we are going to hear from a young man, Matt, who has a mental illness called bi-polar. Ask if anyone remembers from the earlier lesson what bi-polar is? (see [http://walkinourshoes.org/mental-health-challenges/)](http://walkinourshoes.org/mental-health-challenges/)) 

(Note to teacher: characteristics to note about bi-polar include: mood fluctuations; intensity of feelings; intense feelings of happiness or mania or manic episode; intense sadness or depression; difficulty thinking clearly; difficulty sleeping.) 

DO/EXPERIENCE (1) Write the following questions on the board. Let the students know that you will be asking them these questions after they view Matt's story. These questions are a "heads up" so they know what to listen for specifically. 

- How does Matt describe his bi-polar? 

- When did he have a manic episode? What did he say he experienced during that time? 

- Who are some of the people that helped Matt? 

- Do you think Matt did the right thing telling his new friends about his mental illness?     Why or Why not? 

- What has he done to deal with his bi-polar and live a happy life? 

(2) Go to [http://walkinourshoes.org/our-stories/matt](http://walkinourshoes.org/our-stories/matt) and play Matt's story. 


## REFLECT 

Ask the students what they thought of Matt's story. Then review the questions you had written earlier on the board. 

APPLY Return to the WalkinOurShoes website and as a class take the 4-item survey. https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/MattStory 

Answers: #1 True #2 True #3 False #4 Mental Retardation 


# Lesson #7: Walk in Our Shoes 

Objectives: Students will identify characteristics that make them special. 

Time: 30 minutes 

Materials: Computer with web access [http://walkinourshoes.org/shoes/gallery](http://walkinourshoes.org/shoes/gallery) Projector Sheets of drawing paper for each student Assorted pens, pencils, crayons, markers 

Preparation In this lesson students will create shoes that best reflect characteristics about themselves. They will be asked to write below the shoes 2-3 phrases that best describe who they are and qualities that make them special. Teachers should prepare their own shoes ahead of time to share later with students. 

## ENGAGE 

Ask the group to think about an adult in their life that they have a relationship with and that they look up to. This could be a parent, aunt or uncle, older sibling, coach, pastor, teacher, neighbor, etc. Ask students to think about what this person would say makes "you" special? Ask if anyone would like to share what they think would be said about them? 

DO/EXPERIENCE (1) Go to the walkinourshoes.org website to demonstrate to the students what types of shoes others have created to reflect characteristics and qualities about themselves. [http://walkinourshoes.org/shoes](http://walkinourshoes.org/shoes) Click through all three pages shoes, words and finished products, creating a "class shoe" as you move through the pages and create a shoe exercise. 

(2) Let the students know that today they will be making their own shoes. Distribute paper, markers, crayons, etc. Ask students to draw a shoe of their choice and to identify 2 3 phrases that best describe who they are. These qualities should be written on the drawing paper after the shoes have been drawn. 

(Note to teacher: You may want to project again the "choose your shoe page" and "pick your words" page to help with ideas). 


## REFLECT 

After students have completed their shoes, ask for volunteers to share what they have done. You can model what you want students to do by being the first to share your shoe and the phrases that best describe you. 

Ask 

- How did it feel to choose a shoe that best describes you? and to choose the words that     best describe you? 

- What made it difficult or easy to share good things about you? 

- Did anyone hear any surprises or things they didn't know about someone? 

(Note to teacher: You may want to summarize by noting the commonalities across the phrases students have chosen and what were the differences. Note that all of us have things we share in common and things that make us special and unique. No one can truly know what it is like to walk in another person's shoes. Yet, sharing who we are helps people see us in a positive way, making it harder for people to stigmatize us). 

APPLY (This could be a homework assignment) Have students write a paragraph about what they think the phrase "walk in our shoes" means and why it is an appropriate term to use when learning about mental health challenges. 


# Lesson #8: Let's Ace This Test 

Objectives: Students will demonstrate knowledge of mental illnesses. 

Time: 30 minutes 

Materials: Index cards to use for A,B,C,D answer cards Small prizes for correct answers Quiz questions and answers (see end of lesson plan) Three Things I Learned about Mental Health Challenges Worksheet with copies for each student 

## ENGAGE 

Ask if students have ever wanted to talk or share answers while taking a test. Let them know that today they will be taking a test in groups to see how much they have learned about mental health challenges. 

DO/EXPERIENCE 

(1) Divide students into groups of three. (2) Provide each group with 4 large index cards and have group members label cards with A,B,C,D (3) Read questions aloud (4) Have each group raise their answer card on the count of three. (5) Share the correct answer. (6) Award prizes to the winning team. 

REFLECT Discuss with students: 

- Why is it important for us to know more about mental health challenges? 

- How many of you feel you have learned more about mental health than when we first started     this unit? 

APPLY 


Have students complete the Three Things I Learned About Mental Health Challenges Worksheet. Review responses.
