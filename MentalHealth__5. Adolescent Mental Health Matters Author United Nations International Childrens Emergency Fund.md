## Background and Purpose 

Adolescent Mental Health has increasingly become an important global health and development priority, with recognition that that: 

**- Adolescents have a right to quality mental health care and psychosocial support services** 

**- Mental well-being is central to adolescent health and development,** and is impacted by a     range of complex family, cultural, societal, economic and environmental factors that put the     mental health of young people at elevated risk. 

**- Mental well-being among adolescents predicts a range of risk behaviors** , including self-     harm, tobacco and alcohol use, drug misuse, risky sexual behaviors, and violence - the     effects of which persist throughout the life course. 

**- Mental well-being impacts the capacity of young people** to learn, participate, and be     productive members of society. 

**Up to 50% of all mental health conditions start before the age of 14 years. Suicide is one of the three leading causes of death among adolescents**^1 

Given the adolescent burden of disease and disability caused by poor mental health and the impact of mental well-being on the survival, growth and development of young people, this is a priority area of action for UNICEF. This landscape analysis was conducted to: 

- Provide a cross-sectional reference point of UNICEF’s AMHPSS efforts at the global,     regional, and country level 

- Highlight strengths and critical factors influencing UNICEF’s work in AMHPSS 

- Identify opportunities for strengthening UNICEF’s AMHPSS strategies, policies, and     programs 

 BOX: LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS PROCESS The landscape analysis was conducted between JulySeptember 2019 and included: 

- Key informant interviews within UNICEF HQ, Regional, and Country office teams across     different sections; 

- Country AMHPSS program data collection through a survey tool and data analysis; 

- Desk review of UNICEF strategy and policy documents, technical reports, 

- bulletins, program tools, websites, peer-reviewed articles and meeting reports.

## What has been 

## done to date? 

Over the past decade, UNICEF has worked to advance AMHPSS through the following key areas: 

- Policy and advocacy 

- Technical tools and guideline development     including guidance documents, monitoring     tools, and programmatic frameworks 

- Programming (promotive,     preventive, screening, care,     treatment, and rehabilitation) 

- Research and evidence generation including     epidemiological studies, situational analyses,     needs assessments, and program evaluation 

- Adolescent and Youth engagement in     AMHPSS policy, programming and research

**GUIDANCE** 

 PROGRAMMING & PARTNERSHIP 

 2017: Consultations were undertaken with experts on gendered influence on AMH in LMICs with the International Centre for Research on Women (IRCW), among practitioners and implementers on what it would require to develop programming for AMH, on evidence and data, and with young people around their health and well-being, including mental health. 

 2018: A number of efforts were initiated to develop guidance on MHPSS for adolescents including an IRC Gap Map, operationalization of community-based MHPSS in humanitarian settings, 2nd decade guidance which mentions mental health, and the Helping Adolescents Thrive (HAT) guidelines with WHO. 

 2019: Emphasis has been placed on strengthening programming and partnerships in response to mental health and wellbeing of adolescents. This includes the Leading Minds Conference, development of the HAT intervention package with WHO, development of an MHPSS technical note, and a new partnership with Netherlands on developing a Minimum Services Package in Humanitarian settings.

_- Our Future, Our Health: Multicountry_     _Consultations with Young People on Primary_     _Healthcare_ highlighted that mental health was     repeatedly raised as one of the most important     health concerns for adolescents, along with the     lack of access to services. 


## What has been done at 

## the regional level? 

At the regional level, the AMH response has differed according to regional priorities and resources. At least two regions (LACRO and ECARO) have dedicated resources to AMHPSS as a standalone area of programming under Health programming. In other settings, AMHPSS is integrated into other responses, most commonly Child Protection, particularly in emergency settings, and HIV in both the general adolescent population and in selected key populations in different regions. 

**Region Key contextual issues Programme responses Research and evidence** 

 LACRO Good epidemiological data, strong community-based responses for health, good partnerships between sectors. Limited government budgets, lack of prioritization, limited integration into primary health care, lack of available evidence-based programmes 

 Mental health standalone area, included in regional plan, focus on participation in MMAP, evidence generation, and policy implementation 

 Conducted two comprehensive situation analyses guiding the response in the region including a mental health-specific mapping 

 ECARO Differing priorities and resource levels across the region. Relatively well-resourced social services systems and availability of tertiary-level training for providers. Emerging use of telemedicine and online tools. Mental health often specialized service, meaning not integrated into primary care and community-based services are under-developed. Stigma resent, partly due to legacy of past political abuse of psychiatric care system. Number of special at-risk groups including HIV, refugees and migrants, adolescents affected by violence and abuse, adolescents in care. Parental consent often needed to access care. 

 Support of large suicide prevention programming in Kazakhstan Integration of mental health into other areas of programming (e.g. HIV) Regional-level genderresponsive adolescent life skills framework. Emerging use of tele-medicine and online tools to support mental health in the region 

 Programme evaluations (e.g. Kazakhstan programme). International adolescent mental health conferences held in 2018 and 2019. Regional review of parenting programmes 


**Region Key contextual issues Programme responses Research and evidence** 

 EAPRO Strong focus and leadership involved in responses to key populations, digital tools widely used, focus on adolescent engagement No budget allocated to mental health at regional level, government funding also limited, uncertainty about priority areas for action 

 Mental health integrated into responses for key adolescent populations including adolescents with HIV and married adolescents 

 Focus on getting data and evidence for key populations to guide programming efforts 

 ESARO Region has highest rates of adolescent HIV globally with large predicted youth population bulge. UNICEF has well-established relationships with country governments in maternal and child health, HIV, early childhood development, and education. AMHPSS is not seen as a government priority in the region, largely due to other health priorities in the region. There are limited available epidemiological data for the region. Lack of technical capacity for mental health. 

 Most AMHPSS-related service delivery in the region is integrated into the HIV response. COs in the region support implementing partners and country governments to develop services such as peer support and group interventions for adolescents with HIV. Some programmes have been evaluated and scaled to other areas, but most are limited in size. Quality of programmes is varied. There are various activities to engage adolescents in the region, through UNICEFsupported activities such as U-Report and national-level adolescent committees. There are a number of entry points for AMHPSS services to exist, including HIV services, care for pregnant adolescents, and school-based health services. 

 Two regional assessments on HIV services have highlighted initiatives that integrate AMHPSS into HIV care. A mapping activity on refugee children was conducted to assess service delivery for this group, whih found limited focus on MHPSS. The Transfer Project is running in ten countries in the region. The aim of the project is to measure the impact of cash transfers on a range of outcomes, including AMH. 

 ROSA Large population of adolescents, high levels of inequality across the region and a sharp urban-rural divide. Strong UNICEF communication is present in the region with the capacity to push out messages to wide audiences as well as a well-developed presence at the subnational level with the ability to influence decision-making around policies and programming. Gender disparities including genderbased violence and adolescent marriage place girls at risk for mental health conditions and limit access to AMHPSS. There is considerable pressure on adolescents to do well at school and high rates of bullying in schools, and use of corporal punishment. Same-sex relationships are thereby illegal limiting access to services. 

 AMHPSS is integrated into ADAP, child protection and education activities in the region and included in the health response to a limited extent. There is also a focus on life skills initiatives in the region, delivered both through school and after school or community club platforms. Other regionallevel initiatives include the development of a hotline for child and adolescent abuse and counselling, using the same number across different countries. UNICEF is also supporting child protection networks in countries. Media, such as radio, has been used to educate adolescents about AMH concepts. 

 ROSA completed gender assessment which notes that AMH was identified as an area requiring further policy and programming. Linked to this, there has been extensive mapping of work on child marriage in the region and documentation of AMHPSS responses for this group (limited). Conducted study on social workforce which includes some information on mental health training that social workers receive across the region, which is variable. Documented challenges in the report including low levels of training, poorly resourced systems, high workload, and weak information systems. 


**Region Key contextual issues Programme responses Research and evidence** 

 WCARO Number of acute and protracted emergencies, resulting from conflict, communicable disease outbreaks, climate change, fragile governments, mass displacement and rapid urbanisation and large numbers of unaccompanied adolescents, victims of sexual violence and children recruited by armed groups. Widespread recognition of the importance of MHPSS by governments, particularly in emergency settings and well-established links with country governments. UNICEF is able to influence approaches to AMHPSS. Competing disease priorities mainly from communicable diseases and maternal and child health concerns, weak government mental health services, and weak referral systems. Adolescents can be difficult to reach, as they often enter the workforce early or are married. Online tools have limited reach, but radio outreach programmes have been used. High levels of stigma. Limited funding for MHPSS programmes. 

 MHPSS programming mostly linked to Child Protection. There is an active regional child protection working group which includes MHPSS in its focus. Existing child friendly spaces that are implemented in conflictaffected areas, some life skills programmes in schools, and community-based services available in countries, provided by non-specialist workers through NGOs. There are child protection community networks in many places, supported by WCARO. In some countries, WCARO is working with government to improve training curricula for MHPSS workers and to assist them to set up MHPSS systems. Nonemergency states rely on IASC resources and adapt them for the local context (e.g. Gambia). Most recently, WCARO has been supporting the MHPSS response to the outbreak in the DRC. 

 Respondents noted a lack of data and evidence for the region. 

 MENARO MHPSS programmes have been developed in response to humanitarian crises and conflict. Country governments recognise the importance of AMHPSS. Factors limiting the AMHPSS response in country include lack of data, the lack of integration into adolescent health services, limited trained and supervised human resources, and the high cost of accessing care. Many AMH services are privatised meaning that they are not accessible to all. 

 MHPSS response situated in the Child Protection section and in Education section, which supports regional work on life skills. MENARO has been an organisational leader in UNICEF’s work in life skills with the development of a regional life skills framework with an emphasis on curriculum reform, teacher training, quality content and access for out-of-school youth. Regional digital youth forum which provides a platform for knowledge sharing and discussion on a number of issues facing young people in the region, including mental health and well-being. 

 Several regional mapping activities have taken place, including one of the life skills programmes, from across the MENA region, MHPSS projects targeting children and youth (currently underway), and parenting programmes. Based on the recommendations of the AAHA! Framework, MENARO conducted a landscape analysis of adolescent health and well-being. Research symposium was held in 2018 with a focus on issues facing adolescents and youth in the region. MENARO has also supported participatory action research with adolescents in the region, particularly around the links between gender and adolescent well-being. 


## What has been done at 

## the country level? 

###### Current approaches to policy and advocacy 

###### Current approaches to programming 

UNICEF country office (CO) activities in adolescent mental health vary greatly. This section is intended to provide an overview of different approaches that countries are engaging in regarding the following areas: i) policy and advocacy, ii) programming (promotion, prevention and treatment in the general population and in special populations), iii) tool and guideline development, iv) research and evidence and v) adolescent engagement. See the country case studies in Annex 1. 

Current programming varies in scope, scale and target population by country. Activities can be considered in terms of a continuum of care and support from those that focus primarily on promoting positive mental health to those that are designed to provide treatment services for adolescents with mental health conditions. 

 Building multisectoral collaboration for AMH Developing coordination mechanisms or working committees with representatives from different government sectors to address AMH 

 Development of expert country networks Creation of expert groups 

 Advocating directly with governments Engaging with policy makers directly to integrate mental health into existing health response for adolescents and/or improve mental health services

 Integration of mental health care into youth-friendly health services, provision of counseling, supporting provision of psychiatric and psychological services 


###### Current approaches to prevention and treatment 

###### in special at-risk populations 

UNICEF has particularly strong programming and activities for adolescents from at-risk groups who are vulnerable to mental health conditions. The types of groups that are targeted vary greatly according to priority issues in each region and country. In many cases, COs report providing mental health support through other programmes targeted at these groups. Activities cover a range of AMHPSS responses, including selective prevention programmes, indicated interventions, and provision of treatment. 

 Special populations 

**Examples of current activities and/or entry points at country level** 

 Adolescents in humanitarian emergencies 

 Training frontline workers in identification and referral Child friendly spaces, safe spaces for adolescent girls Safe schools Provision of psychosocial programmes in community, formal and informal education settings Peer support groups Support programmes for parents and caregivers Support programmes for survivors of sexual violence Vocational and skills training Seed funding for entrepreneurship Sports and other recreational activities Adolescents exposed to violence

###### Current approaches to incorporating digital tools in programming 

###### Current approaches to tool and guideline development 

COs report using a range of digital tools to engage around issues of AMH and related areas. Digital tools are used to provide information about mental health and available services as well as a service provision platform. For the most part, these approaches and programming responses are still under development and are not yet tested. 

Several COs report engaging in activities to develop technical tools for use in countries to support of implementation of AMH programming. 

 Websites Provision of information on AMH and available services for adolescents, referral to services, information about programming for providers 

 Mobile phones Two-way SMS feedback on services, counselling service via SMS or chatbot, referral to AMH services Psychological counselling via phone 

 Social Media Social media platforms used to provide information on AMH-related issues through widespread campaigns 

 TV and radio Using TV and radio to reduce stigma and share information about AMH issues within stories or shows 

 U-Report Use of U-Report platform to garner adolescent views on AMH issues 

 AMH training packages Developing coordination mechanisms or working committees with representatives from different government sectors 

 Costing tools Development of methodology to assess costs of adolescent mental health services across different sectors 

 Service standards, clinical practice guides, programmatic guidelines Development of clinical standards, treatment protocols, guidance for clinical practice and/or standardized procedures, tools, curricula and indicators for AMH services 

 Services mapping Mapping of services, particularly in humanitarian settings 


###### Current approaches to research and evidence 

###### Current approaches to adolescent engagement 

Several COs report involvement in local-level research projects relating to AMH. For the most part, these were developed in order to develop a better understanding of the burden of disease relating to AMH, risk factors for AMH problems and available services. To a lesser extent, COs reported involvement in evaluation studies of programmes that had been undertaken. Commonly, COs report using study results to advocate with governments for more investment into AMH services. 

UNICEF has well-developed platforms for engaging and consulting with youth that are being used for AMHrelated issues. There are a number of reported examples of UNICEF COs promoting and supporting the engagement of adolescents in policy and programming work. 

 Descriptive studies Epidemiological studies, descriptions of risk and protective factors for AMH (both quantitative and qualitative) 

 Engagement in conferences Promoting participation of adolescents in conferences relating to AMH, including presentations and online content 

 AMH service descriptions Description of AMH systems and services in countries, across different levels of prevention and treatment, across multiple sectors 

 Adolescent forums, meetings, and networks Bringing adolescents, families and other stakeholders together through structured meetings and networks treatment, across multiple sectors 

 Routine data gathering Regular tracking and reporting of servicerelated information, inclusion of AMH indicators in national surveys 

 Digital media Using digital media to collect adolescent opinions and ideas 

 Cost effectiveness studies Assessment of cost effectiveness of interventions 

 Training courses and skills development Training adolescents in advocacy and other activities 

 Programme evaluations Evaluations of the impact on AMH of mental health-specific interventions, or other interventions with potential benefit for AMH 

 Other adolescentfriendly activities Using adolescentfriendly and appealing activities to engage in education and elicit opinions from adolescents e.g. hackathons, sports events 


###### Leveraging UNICEF’s strengths to accelerate action for adolescent 

###### mental health 

UNICEF’s comparative advantages give it a distinctive position to accelerate action towards improving the mental well-being of adolescents. 

###### Advocacy and building strategic partnerships 

UNICEF is the global leader on issues affecting children and adolescents and is centrally placed to advocate for the importance of strengthening a global AMHPSS response. UNICEF has longstanding links across the UN system, national governments, youth networks, technical partners, and the private sector across the world. This uniquely allows UNICEF to build strategic partnerships to support development of solutions in a diverse range of contexts. Its strong communication for development capacity and experience using mass media to highlight complex issues affecting children is also critical to increasing awareness, demand, and engagement of young people in ensuring positive mental well-being. 

###### Ecological and life course approach 

UNICEF recognises that child and adolescent development is influenced by factors at multiple levels and uses an ecological framework to understand risk and protective factors at the individual, inter-personal, socio-economic, physical environment, and policy levels. As a result, UNICEF works across all sectors that impact children and adolescents, using longstanding connections with different national ministries (Health, Education, Social Development, and others) and is well-placed to promote whole-of-government responses to address the well-being of children and adolescents. UNICEF recognises the importance of engaging adolescents’ caregivers in programming and that programmes are more likely to be successful and sustained when families are involved and has recently begun to engage in promoting parenting programmes, which include parents of adolescents. UNICEF embraces a life course approach and as such, has expertise in a range of programming relating to AMHPSS, including maternal and child health, early childhood development and adolescent health. 

###### Strong in-country presence and experience 

UNICEF is actively running programmes in countries across different levels of government, working closely with national and subnational governments as well as civil society partners. UNICEF has the capacity to take programmes to scale. Current approaches to AMH tend to be pilot studies with limited roll out, but UNICEF has extensive experience in developing and implementing programming for children and adolescents across countries and will be able to leverage this experience in rolling out AMHPSS programming. UNICEF has a strong background in MHPSS services in humanitarian settings. The agency is a global leader in MHPSS for children and adolescents, with dedicated technical capacity at all levels. There are a number of seminal 


normative documents that UNICEF has developed or contributed to which have relevance for non-emergency settings and there is a great deal of potential for lessons learned in the humanitarian context to be applied to other developmental states. 

###### Engagement with adolescents 

UNICEF has extensive networks of young people in regions and countries, and is, therefore, able to engage a large number of adolescents through the U-Report platform. These connections can be leveraged to inform the development, roll out and evaluation of programming for this group, and to ensure that programming is accessible, acceptable and sustainable. Efforts to engage youth can also be used as platforms to provide information on mental health and to create demand for services. 

 BOX: Critical factors influencing UNICEF’s work in AMHPSS Stakeholders across global, regional and country levels report a number of positive and negative factors that influence UNICEF’s current and potential future role in AMH policy and programming. 

- Lack of UNICEF frameworks, guidelines and endorsed     programmes in AMH 

- Confusion about definitions and roles of different sections 

- Country level factors including resources, stigma,     priortisation, weak systems, lack of multisectoral     responses, legal barriers 

- Lack of epidemiological data and programme evaluations 

- Limited scale up of successsful programmes 

- Few funders 

- Widespread awareness of importnance of AMH 

- High level prioritisation of AMH 

- Existing capacity in some sections and regions 

- Engagement of adolescents 

- Engagement of family members 

- Demand for services 


## From learning agenda to action: 

## what next? 

Based on the results of the landscaping assessment, in order to take the learning agenda to the action stage, the following key recommendations are made: 

###### Promote a whole-of-government approach to strengthen MHPSS in 

###### order to tailor to the needs of adolescents 

UNICEF should continue to prioritise adolescents as a focus area and to support the strengthening of AMHPSS services that are tailored to the needs and developmental stage of adolescents. UNICEF should work in partnerships with governments and other country-level partners to strengthen policies and programming across the continuum of services and care, using a multisectoral approach. Multisectoral partners include Health (integration into primary care, leveraging access points through nutrition, HPV vaccination), Education (safe schools, bullying interventions, transferable skills programmes), and Child Protection (parenting programmes, adolescent spaces, community networks) and others. UNICEF should support efforts to create an enabling environment to improve adolescent mental health at the country level, including legislative and regulatory improvements (removing barriers to care and restricting access to tobacco, alcohol and drugs), gender-sensitive policy development, adequate financing and infrastructure development. 

###### Increase efforts towards prevention and early intervention 

Interventions to promote positive mental health and prevent mental health conditions aim to strengthen the ability of adolescents to regulate their emotions, develop their interpersonal skills and relationships, improve their capacity to solve difficult problems with the resources available to them, and promote supportive social environments and networks. 

The HAT intervention package, under development in partnership with WHO, is designed for universal delivery to promote adolescent mental health, and prevent mental disorders, risky behaviours and self-harm among adolescents. UNICEF should continue to be actively engaged in these processes with WHO and other key partners. The next steps of intervention package development include the addition of content for selective groups. UNICEF should promote the use of existing entry points with special populations in countries as service delivery platforms for HAT. For indicated level prevention efforts, screening and case identification, UNICEF should continue to support efforts to screen and refer adolescents with high levels of symptoms. 


###### Support development, piloting and scale up of new service delivery 

###### models for AMHPSS 

To improve treatment services, UNICEF should support the development and piloting of innovative service delivery models to provide counselling and treatment for adolescents with mental health conditions. These can include integrating mental health into existing services for adolescents (e.g. into adolescent-friendly health services) as well as adapting service delivery models that have been successful in improving access to care in other related areas (including adult mental health programming), such as task shifting to lay health workers, collaborative care services, home visiting and home-based care, and parental training. Digital environments, schools, and community organisations all should be considered as potential platforms for delivery of AMHPSS services. 

###### Invest in building data and evidence on adolescent mental health 

UNICEF should establish a data and evidence agenda on issues relating to AMHPSS focused on three areas: 

- Firstly, inclusion of indicators relating to AMHPSS in the indicator framework of the Strategic Plan. This     will allow for tracking of country and regional-level activities to strengthen the mental health response. 

- Secondly, monitoring of AMHPSS outcomes using the MMAP tool. The next steps of the MMAP project will     be to validate the tool in three countries, after which it should be integrated into national and subnational     level surveys, including MICS. 

- Thirdly, generating implementation-related evidence through evaluation of programming, specifically     on the implementation and evaluation of scale up of evidence-based interventions. This will allow for     generation of lessons about how to scale up interventions that have been successful at small scale in     countries. 

###### Engage and build capacity of

UNICEF should increase and continue to support meaningful engagement of young people through establishing and building upon existing mechanisms for their participation, as well as support (capacity building and mentoring) them to contribute at the global, regional, and country levels. The support of ADAP will be important to ensure that the uniquely critical perspectives and skills from adolescents and youth drive and inform AMHPSS policy and program recommendations as well as implementation and research.

IDEnTIfICATIon of PRoblEM To CoMMUnITY-bASED ACTIon 

Among adolescents in China, suicide is the third leading cause of premature mortality, following drowning and road traffic accidents. A 2017 survey of 15,415 adolescents reported that 40% of respondents had self-harmed in the past year, and one-third reported feelings of anxiety. Issues identified to affect China’s adolescent population include family separation, isolation, internet addiction and lack of socialisation and social skills^1. 

Importantly, rural-urban inequalities and migration are critical issues threatening the wellbeing of adolescents, particularly for rural and “left-behind children”. China’s rapid economic growth has resulted in the largest internal migration in history. Millions of parents from rural regions leave their children behind to find work in urban areas. The country’s unique household registration system (Hukou) denies most rural children access to urban education and health services. Consequently, 61 million rural children were left behind by their parents between 2010 and 2015. These children have been found to suffer higher rates of suicide ideation and depression, with suicide rates threefold that of urban children^2. large discrepancies also 

 exist in terms of service provision between rural and urban areas. Many adolescents 15 years and older do not continue with senior secondary education and drop out of school to migrate for work 3. Entering the work force, these out-of-school adolescents often lack the social and emotional skills necessary to cope in a work environment. With increased financial independence and parental absence, risk behaviours among adolescents such as tobacco use, drug abuse and unprotected sex are increasing 4. 

###### Laws and policies promoting 

###### adolescent mental health 

 The Chinese government is aware of the burden of mental illness and has taken legislative action: China’s first Mental Health Law entered into effect in 2013. For children and adolescents, the law aims to promote psychological wellbeing and prevent mental disorders through school-based counselling services. Every school is required to have a counselling unit with at least one professional counsellor. A series of regulations have been issued to guide the provision of mental health services in schools.

following the suicide of four abandoned siblings in 2015, governments have recently been prioritizing adolescent mental health and well-being, especially of children that have been left-behind At the community level, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has now been mandated with early screening and detection. new laws are being enacted to mitigate the negative effects of the hukou system to allow the children of migrants access to education if they move with their parents. 

###### UNICEF’s Work 

UnICEf has recently been asked to take up programming and support for adolescent mental health at the request of the government. The Adolescent Health and Development Demonstration 

 Project is jointly conducted by China’s national Health Commission and UnICEf. 

 The project aims to provide evidence related to adolescent health and wellbeing to inform policy development and intervention, to advocate for multi-sectoral cooperation and to develop a comprehensive service model that meets the needs of adolescents. Key project intervention areas include mental health, injury and violence prevention, sexual and reproductive health and promoting healthy lifestyles. The project targets adolescents, their parents and caregivers, health providers and teachers, as well as leaders and policy makers in health and education. UnICEf is well positioned to work on this issue because it links key sectors and programming needed to address adolescent health holistically. 

**Box 1. UNICEF China’s initiatives that support adolescent mental health:** 

 Child-Friendly Spaces originally established for children affected by the Wenchuan earthquake, child-friendly spaces provide protection services, recreation activities, and non-formal education to vulnerable children. Staff are trained to recognise warning signs of violence, abuse and exploitation, provide psychosocial support, and to refer children to services. The Government has subsequently actioned Children’s Places nationally, aiming to provide one Children’s Place in 90% of all urban and rural communities by 2020. 

 Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) project 

 The SEl Project focuses on improving students’ social and emotional competences (self-awareness, social-awareness, interpersonal relationships, communication and decision-making) and build capacities of teachers and principals to create an enabling learning environment. Assessment of the SEL model showed that children in project schools demonstrated improved self-confidence, communication, interpersonal skills and the ability to cope with challenges. The MoE has also agreed to extend SEl to teacher education universities to strengthen the training of teachers in China. Adolescent Life Skills Programme 

 The “Step into the Society” vocational education curriculum empowers adolescents with social, civic and financial knowledge. This gender-sensitive life skills training package covers topics such as independence and self-management, interpersonal skills and communication, career development, social and emotional learning and financial education. In support of the education and development of out-of-school adolescents, UnICEf is also working to improve the quality of teaching and learning in vocational schools and non-formal venues. UnICEf in partnership with the MoE drafted two life skills modules on interpersonal skills and social and emotional learning for senior secondary vocational school students. 

 Barefoot Social Workers Community members are trained and supervised to deliver child welfare services, in order to identify children in need, support them in seeking services, and raise community awareness on child protection issues. Through this initiative, vulnerable children receive social assistance, guardianship arrangements, health care and training for parents. The government adopted this model to strengthen the care and protection of children left behind in rural areas by migrant parents and other vulnerable children. 


Aligned to the organisation’s equity focus, much of UnICEf China’s work takes place in rural parts of western and central China, where many of the most vulnerable adolescents are located. While UnICEf currently does not have a specific focus on age groups or on a particular category of adolescents (such as left-behind, or migrant adolescents), many programmes (see Box 1) are reaching these groups^5. 

###### UNICEF China’s Adolescent 

###### Mental Health Programme 

Informed by an epidemiology review, situation and stakeholder analysis, UnICEf developed a comprehensive programme to specifically address adolescent mental health. Implemented by UnICEf’s Health, nutrition and WASH division, the initiative works to establish direct programme linkage between their health and education programming, with mental health screening, counselling and referral mechanisms integrated into school 

 curricula and health facilities’ routine services. 

 The programme focuses on preventative intervention, prioritising awareness, screening and supporting positive mental health (stress reduction, coping skills, support groups). This includes building adolescent’s knowledge and skills for better mental health and providing information on when and where to access services. Services are delivered through a combination of school, health and community settings, linked with professional psychological institutes. The programme also uses technology avenues such as Weibo and Wechat to deliver services to adolescents. In school settings, UnICEf supported the development of new mental health screening guidelines that help teachers identify adolescents in need of support and train them to facilitate mental health support groups. 

 UNICEF’s adolescent mental health service package includes: 

- Positive psychology manual and group     guidance in schools for adolescents,     teachers and parents 

- Stress reduction and attention exercises 

- Screening for psychological disorders in     health facilities 

- family counselling 

- Campus crisis intervention in schools 

5 UNICEF in China and Beyond. 2019. 


Through its development and implementation, several learnings have emerged. Multi-sectoral cooperation needs to be strengthened to address lack of synergies between sectors and develop the capacity of service providers from different sectors to address adolescent mental health. Adolescent involvement needs to be prioritised so that adolescents are meaningfully engaged in the design and implementation of interventions that affect them. While views are changing, traditional hierarchies of authority often limit the opportunities to engage adolescents in this process. UnICEf is uniquely positioned to advocate for young people’s involvement in political dialogues and to create 

 platforms that engage adolescents in policy and program design. Confucian traditions prioritise education and many parents place immense pressure on their children to succeed academically. As a response, parents need to be engaged in mental health programming, addressing the resulting pressure and stress that adolescents face. Innovative approaches are needed to work with traditions, while still finding ways to address the current challenges affecting adolescents. UnICEf could facilitate partnership with local organisations and authorities, drawing on international expertise as needed. 


## THAILAND 

REACHInG ADolESCEnTS THRoUGH E-SERvICES AnD CAPACITY-bUIlDInG of CARE PRovIDERS 

Health services in Thailand are fragmented, often lacking sensitivity to adolescents’ needs. Adolescent mental health specifically has received little attention, even though suicide is one of the leading causes of death among Thai adolescents^6. Results from the 2015 Global School-based Student Health Survey showed that 1 in 8 students (13%) had attempted suicide in the preceding 12 months^7. However, the number of professionals across Thailand that provide counselling to adolescents are limited, and those available mostly work in specialised health facilities, which restricts adolescent’s access to these services. 

Another key challenge for adolescents in Thailand relates to their sexual and reproductive health. Adolescent pregnancy is currently a major national concern, since the adolescent pregnancy rate in Thailand is three times that of the region^8. for every 1,000 live births, 60 are to adolescent females^9. This translates into almost 300 girls aged 15-19 giving birth every day. Due to social stigma against unplanned pregnancies and adolescent sexuality, adolescent mothers generally receive little social 

 support from their families and the community. In Thailand, young mothers make up a substantial proportion (40%) of the country’s child support grant beneficiaries, indicating their additional financial vulnerability 10. 

 Results from the 2015 Global School-based Student Health Survey showed that nearly one in five students (13-17 years) have had sexual intercourse, and that 40% of them did so before they were 14 years old^11. At this age (and until they turn 18), children in Thailand still require their parent’s signature to access reproductive health services. This indicates that the average age Thai adolescents become sexually active vastly precedes the age at which they are able to access relevant services without adult consent. As a result, many sexually active adolescents lack access to contraception and sexual health counselling. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Thailand is facing an increase in HIv and sexually transmitted infections (STI) cases, with 70% of all STI cases occurring among young people^12. lack of knowledge and misinformation around sex and contraceptive methods (especially from online

###### UNICEF’s Work 

UnICEf Thailand’s Adolescent Development and Participation division works to increase key healthy behaviour practices among adolescents. Towards this goal, UnICEf supports the development of capacity-building programmes for care providers, to enable them to provide adolescent-friendly and gender-sensitive services. UnICEf also works to increase adolescent participation in the planning and delivery of services that respond to their needs. At the policy level, they aim to increase investments that strengthen the delivery of adolescentsensitive programmes. 

**Using e-services to address adolescent mental health** 

Adolescents in Thailand lack access to relevant health information and services, especially around mental health and comprehensive sex education. Where services are available, social norms, stigma and discrimination often serve as barriers to access them^13. The anonymity of the internet takes away the fear of stigma and discrimination, where adolescents in Thailand have very high access to and make substantial use of the internet. online platforms are therefore well-placed to reach adolescents and provide them with muchneeded information and services. 

lovecarestation.com is an internet health promotion and counselling platform run by local NGO Path2Health. The platform’s focus was initially 

 on HIv, and with UnICEf support, the platform expanded to include sexual and reproductive health, including for men having sex with men. With the vision to offer comprehensive services on health topics that are of importance to young people, mental health information and basic online counselling and referral services were added to the platform. over 770,000 adolescents used the platform in 2018, particularly for information on contraception and teenage pregnancy. This was a significant jump from 150,000 users in 2017. Moreover, in 2018, 7,209 young people registered for its online counselling and referral services, the majority (5,334) being girls aged 10-25 years^14. 

 Building the capacity of care providers to address adolescent mental health 

 To address adolescent challenges related to mental health as well as sexual reproductive health, UnICEf Thailand has worked to build the capacity of care providers (such as teachers, nurses and hospital staff) who work directly with adolescents to address these issues. 

 A screening tool for adolescent depression. While national clinical guidelines are available for

general depression screening, practitioners in community settings lack practical tools to identify adolescents in need of mental health support. As a result, practitioners use tools designed for adults, lacking any normative test specifically for Thai adolescents. UnICEf Thailand and the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) developed a Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents 

- a brief, self-report questionnaire that screens for depression among adolescents. The tool was used to establish a national norm on depression for adolescents, helping mental health practitioners and teachers screen adolescents for depression and other mental health concerns. The screening tool is accompanied by a practitioner handbook, outlining the flow of care and standard operating procedures for professionals providing adolescent depression therapy. The use of this tool will facilitate early case detection and the referral of adolescents with depression to accessible services and support. 

Mental health training for service providers. Adolescents have limited access to specialised mental health service providers. UnICEf in collaboration with local NGO Path2Health organised mental health training sessions for service providers who have frequent contact with adolescents through their work. Through the training, pharmacy staff and nurses are equipped to provide adolescent-sensitive counselling, conduct initial mental health screenings and make appropriate referrals to medical or other social services. Mental health training was also added to the Ministry of Public Health’s capacity development of health professionals – mainly nurses, psychologists and health development officers. The MoPH also trained teachers from schools in bangkok on psychological first-aid, mental health screening 

 and the referral system^15. These training initiatives facilitate adolescent’s access to mental health support. 

 UnICEf supported the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Rajanagarindra Institute (CAMRI) to develop a course specifically on counselling for adolescents, and to incorporate this into the existing e-training platform available on CAMRI’s website. The course targets teachers and nurses who work with adolescents on a daily basis and aims to train them in providing counselling to adolescents related to violence against children, game addiction, depression and drug abuse. UnICEf supported the development of “thaiteentraining.com” an online training course on counselling for adolescents. 

 Addressing post-partum depression among young mothers. WHO’s Thinking Healthy toolkit modifies evidencebased psychological treatments into low-intensity psychosocial interventions that can be delivered in settings where specialists and resources are scarce. UnICEf Thailand supported the adaptation and testing of a low-intensity, community-based intervention to address post-partum depression among young mothers (under age 25) receiving the government’s child support grant. UnICEf facilitated collaboration between the departments of Health, Mental Health, and Children and Youth, providing financial support to test the programme’s implementation and document the lessons learnt. The intervention is now being scaled up as part of the government’s post-partum screening package.

## KAZAKHSTAN 

 A DATA-DRIvEn RESPonSE To ADolESCEnT SUICIDE PREvEnTIon 

 Kazakhstan has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, ranking second in the region and sixth globally. Evidence from 1990–2009 showed that Kazakhstan had some of the world’s highest suicide rates for young adults, adolescents and younger children. The country had the world’s highest suicide rate among boys aged 10–14 years and ranked fourth highest for girls of the same age^16. While many other countries showed a decrease in suicide rates, in Kazakhstan suicides increased from 22.5 to 25.6/100,000 17. Mortality among children and teenagers in rural areas tends to be higher than those in urban areas, and approximately 70% of all registered adolescent suicide cases were completed by rural adolescents 18. 

 A recent report described Kazakhstan as a “wasteland for adolescent mental health services”. There is a lack of awareness, skills and resources to address adolescent mental health^19. Those most able to address these issues (e.g. teachers and health providers) lack training and expertise to identify and refer adolescents at risk. Adolescents themselves and their families lack awareness of mental health issues and how to deal with the problem. Until 

 recently, very little was aware of the issue of adolescent suicide or know why the rates are so high. 

 The Government of Kazakhstan increasingly recognised suicide as a prominent public health issue affecting Kazakhstan’s youth. In response to this issue, the Government and UnICEf have taken joint action to improve mental health and to reduce the risk of suicide among this group. Since little was known about the drivers of adolescent suicide, UnICEf and the Ministry of Health proposed a study on the prevalence of suicide and the factors that affect suicide among adolescents. In 2012, the vice Prime-Minister approved the plan to conduct a comprehensive suicide study, a first of its kind in Kazakhstan. 

###### The Suicide Study 

 With financial and technical support from UNICEF, a study on prevalence, underlying causes, risk and protective factors in respect to suicides and attempted suicides in Kazakhstan was launched^20. An international research team, in close collaboration

 20 UNICEF 2014. Study on prevalence, underlying causes, risk and protective factors in respect to suicides and attempted suicides in Kazakhstan 


with UnICEf, the Ministry of Health and national Mental Health Centre, local authorities and civil society organisations, organised three subprojects: 

- Development of a system for case reporting     and analysis of completed suicides based     on the psychological autopsy in 5 regions of     Kazakhstan; 

- Establishment of an epidemiological observatory     on suicide attempts; 

- Evaluation of prevalence and risk factors     associated with suicidal ideation and attempted     suicide. 

The study confirmed that suicidal behaviours are a serious problem for Kazakhstan youth. Psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety, were linked to suicidal behaviour. Almost 70% of high risk pupils and 37% of suicide cases reported mild or moderate symptoms of depression, while 20% of high risk pupils showed severe depression. Suicide cases and high risk pupils showed high impulsivity 

 and aggressiveness, behaviour traits which often facilitate acting out of suicidal thoughts and using severe methods. Suicide was influenced by family history and context, and adolescent’s state of health, personality traits and interpersonal relationships. School psychologists at the time of the study were left to tackle adolescents at risk with lack of support from other sectors, while external mental health workers claimed to have no time or authority to provide support. 

 The study presented a unique perspective on the issue of suicide in Kazakhstan and provided valuable epidemiological data to inform recommendations. Following the study in 2014, UNICEF provided technical assistance in the assessment of adolescent self-harm preventative activities ongoing in the country and provided the Government with a set of recommendations to improve adolescent mental health and prevent suicides. 

 UnICEf’s recommendations were based on the latest WHo guidelines which recommends targeting the issue at primary (universal), secondary (selective) and tertiary (indicated) levels. The importance of careful translation and cultural adaptation of all materials was emphasised and a theme of much importance was that stigma may be preventing persons from seeking help. The findings and recommendations of UnICEf were carefully reviewed by Parliament and Government. In December 2014, the Prime Minister Office requested UnICEf’s technical assistance in developing an adolescent mental health promotion and suicide prevention programme. In turn, Ministries of Education and Health and local governments of all regions were requested to ensure scaling up of the programme nationwide by end of 2018. 

 Prevalence: 

- 1.5% of high school students had attempted     suicide in the past 2 weeks 

- 46.5% of adolescents were identified as at     risk; 3.3% were considered high-risk 

- Risk factors: 

- Poor state of health 

- Substance and tobacco use 

- family history of suicidal behaviours and     mental health problems 

- Exposure to abuse and violence 

- Family, school and peer conflicts 


A joint order from three Government of Kazakhstan Ministries (Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Internal Affairs) was signed in March 2015, giving UNICEF a mandate for staged implementation of a programme to address the alarmingly high rates of mental ill health and suicide among adolescents in Kazakhstan. 

**Promotion of Adolescent Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Programme** UNICEF Kazakhstan and its partners developed a pilot programme, the Promotion of Adolescent Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Programme, to promote mental health and prevent adolescent suicide. The implementation of the programme started in two large pilots in two regions of the country and covered all adolescents at the age 14-17 in 477 schools. The intervention package is unique in its innovative combination of three components: 

- Interactively raising awareness with     adolescents; 

- promoting mental health and health seeking     behavior; 

- identifying adolescents at high risk and ensuring     and improving referral by health and mental     health specialists. 

 Continuity of care was strengthened through a collaborative approach, where school psychologists and general primary healthcare practitioners, composed multidisciplinary teams to follow up adolescents at risk. 

 In line with global recommendations, the pilot grounds its suicide prevention within a broader context of mental health promotion among adolescents and incorporates a complementary approach of both screening and education in its materials. During the pilot phase, stigma was found as the main barrier to access care and treatment. Availability of services was very restricted and relied on a small number of psychiatrists. The programme invested in training and awareness across the health and education sectors, to improve identification and referral of adolescents at risk. The programme also engaged with local government, health care staff and parents to overcome stigma-related barriers. 

 During the first year, the project reached over 35,000 adolescents and 23,630 staff from 312 educational organisations. Impact assessment, costing and evaluation components of the pilot programme, provided evidence to show that the programme contributed to overcoming stigma-based barriers when delivering programme activities, 

 Programme components: 

- Identification of adolescents at risk for     suicide and mental health problems 

- Gatekeeper training for school staff 

- Awareness raising intervention for     adolescents 

- Capacity building of mental health workers     and primary health workers 

- Assessment of the impact of adolescent     suicide prevention 

 Recommendations, informed by the Suicide Study results: 

- Establishment of coordination centres for     suicide prevention 

- Development of a national suicide prevention     plan and a national mental health plan 

- Establishment of an observatory for suicidal     behaviours 

- Performing preventive actions for adolescents     (specifically screening and raising awareness) 

- Mental health professionals and school staff     training 


improving adolescent mental health and well-being, and reducing suicidal ideation. The programme contributed to increasing awareness of mental health issues among adolescents (and their parents), decision makers, gatekeepers and health providers. Importantly, trust greatly increased between adolescents and school psychologists, adolescents and parents, and parents and school staff. School psychologists who previously had low confidence are now recognised by colleagues and parents to be key in mental health promotion and suicide prevention. The evaluation of the programme also emphasised that the pilot’s success was related to the support of the local government office and the close collaboration between the education and health sectors. overcoming family stigma related to mental health and acceptability of the intervention were achieved by applying both top-down and grassrootslevel sensitisation efforts. The pilot started in an area 

 with high political will and generated the momentum needed to reach other geographical areas at a later stage. 

 Recognising these successes, the Government of Kazakhstan recommended scale-up of the programme to other regions of Kazakhstan. With UnICEf’s technical support, large-scale piloting of the programme started in a second region in 2016. Resulted in leveraging resources for further national scaling up, 16 regions (out of 17) reported adjusted budget allocations needed to launch the programme. Prioritisation of adolescent mental health promotion and suicide prevention has resulted in 51% decrease of self-injury mortality in the age group 15-17 at the national level (number of suicide cases decreased from 212 in 2013 to 104 in 2018 in the age group 15-17). 


## ARGENTINA 

 InTERSECToRAl ACTIon To IMPRovE ADolESCEnT MEnTAl HEAlTH 

In Argentina, suicide is the second cause of death in adolescence, after traffic accidents, and in the last 20 years, youth suicide has increased by 4.7 percentage points. Results from the Global Schoolbased Student Health Survey showed that 1 in 6 students (16.2%) had attempted suicide in the preceding 12 months. 

Among adolescent girls and young women aged 10-24, pregnancy and childbirth is the third leading cause of death in this group. Adolescent pregnancy is a persistent challenge, with the adolescent birth rate remaining stable over the last two decades. 

For every 1,000 live births, 64 are to adolescent females, and every year 2,500 babies are born to girls younger than 15. Statistics from the National Plan for the Prevention of Unintentional Pregnancy in Adolescence (Plan EnIA) report that these births are largely a result of incidents of sexual abuse or occur in relationships characterised by unequal power dynamics. 

###### UNICEF’s Work 

 The increasing rates of suicide and violence point to complex problems that affect adolescents’ health and well-being. In Argentina, UnICEf is addressing these issues from an intersectoral perspective, implementing a range of activities to generate evidence, and strengthening support for mental health and reduce violence^21. 

 Raising awareness and generating evidence on issues affecting adolescents 

 UnICEf is advocating for adolescents’ rights to health and working to influence government policies through generating evidence on issues affecting adolescents, such as suicide. UnICEf conducted a descriptive and exploratory study in Argentina on risk factors associated with adolescent suicide. The study included both quantitative and qualitative methods to identify the factors that affect adolescent suicide. In order to provide key stakeholders with important statistical information on the issues affecting the adolescent population of Argentina, UnICEf produces bulletins that include indicators

of adolescent health. The bulletins provide data on adolescent pregnancy and mortality, with a specific emphasis on mortality due to external causes such as accidents, suicide and violence. In addition, UnICEf is supporting intersectoral round-tables for the development of roadmaps and protocols for the care of cases associated with suicide attempts. 

UnICEf also strengthened its relationship with journalists and media outlets, including the most important media groups in the country, in order to increase media coverage of adolescent’s issues. In addition, guidelines were established to improve media coverage on sensitive issues such as violence, suicide, adolescent health and sexual abuse. 

**Mental health promotion** 

**School-based health advisory services** UNICEF Argentina has specifically committed to reductions in suicide rates among adolescents from 11.4 per 100,000 (baseline rates for 2011-2013) to 4.7 per 100,000 (target for 2020). To achieve this, a programme supporting gender-responsive health for suicide prevention has been pioneered through the establishment of school-based health advisory services. UnICEf collaborated with national and local government, secondary schools and nGos to roll out a multi-sectoral approach across education, health and social service sectors. 

A multi-disciplinary team developed guidelines for implementation, including relevant training modules, to support comprehensive health counselling services in secondary schools, directed towards professionals and health teams that carry out health 

 advisory activities in educational institutions. 

 The school-based comprehensive health advisory services aim to: 

- bring the health resources to where adolescents     are 

- Provide a safe and confidential space where     adolescents can obtain timely and reliable health     information, as well as express their emotions     and concerns. 

- Equip adolescents with the tools needed to     resolve issues that they face on a daily basis 

- build relationships of trust between adults and     young people 

 Currently the model is implemented in 64 secondary schools reaching 15,800 adolescents, and will be expanded to 3,000 secondary schools by 2020. baseline data indicated that adolescents consult the advisory services for issues related to sexual and reproductive health, sexual identity, abuse and family violence, violence among peers, suicide and substance use. 

 In addition, UnICEf supported the strengthening of human resources for adolescent mental health, through the development of a diploma in prevention of self-injurious behavior in adolescents, and a suicide training module for high school comprehensive health advisors in 8 provinces. 

 Community mobilisation to address sexual abuse In Argentina it is reported that sexual abuse during adolescence leads to mental breakdown, suicide, and in the case of pregnancy and birth, abandonment of newborns or even infanticide. It is therefore important to intercede with protective measures. 


Towards this aim, UnICEf supported community mobilization and intersectoral communication to improve responses to sexual abuse and associated problems. These efforts included workshops with adults, involvement of local businesses, hosting intersectoral roundtables (Education, Health, Justice, Protection), and adolescent participation in the design of interventions. A modeling document with guidelines was developed to allow for replication of the process in other locations. These activities aim to strengthen child protection efforts and support a multi-sector response for victims of sexual abuse and forced pregnancy. 

**e-Services: Hablemos de Todo** UnICEf launched an online programme “Hablemos de Todo” (“let’s talk about everything”) to provide assistance and promote awareness among adolescents on sexual and reproductive health, gender, violence, suicide and problematic consumption of substances. The platform includes an online chat function to assist young people with questions they may have on these topics. The website’s content and support guides were designed by UnICEf. In six months, the site received more than 120,000 visits and received more than 1,300 queries. 

 Consultation with adolescents UNICEF supported 16 adolescent forums in four provinces in the design and management of public health policies. In total, 2,332 adolescents participated. During these forums, adolescents shared their experiences and beliefs related to issues such as pregnancy and suicide. The adolescents developed proposed solutions and interventions for these issues, and presented policy drafts to the Ministers. In addition, adolescent participation was used in indigenous communities to develop a multisectoral approach in preventing suicide and suicide attempts, often linked to sexual abuse. This included workshops involving adolescents to develop training for families to detect depression among adolescents, in indigenous communities. 


## BELIZE 

InTEGRATIon of MEnTAl HEAlTH InTo nATIonAl HEAlTH PlAnnInG 

In Belize, one in five people is aged 10-19 years. violence, particularly homicide, sexual violence and bullying, are significant adolescent health issues in Belize. Adolescent boys are more likely to drop out of school and become involved with violent gangs or other illegal activities^22. Mental health has emerged as a growing cause of illness for adolescents. Data from Belize’s Health Information System shows that suicide rates nearly tripled between 2014 and 2017, and that among all age groups, adolescents aged 15-19 years have the highest rates of attempted suicides 23. In addition to violence, adolescents are challenged by high rates of teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, road traffic injuries, obesity and depression^24. Mental health and counselling services are largely unavailable, affected by severe limitations in human resources for mental health. 

The newly formulated national Adolescent Health Strategy aims to address all health challenges of adolescents holistically, including mental health. Belize is one of the first countries to adopt the global guidance of Accelerating Action for Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!). based on AA-HA! guidance, 

 UNICEF and partner agencies supported the Belize Ministry of Health (MoH) to evaluate adolescent health needs before developing their national health programme for adolescents 25. This process places extensive emphasis on adolescent participation, and adolescents from across the country provided input through a variety of participatory activities. Adolescent representatives were included in the Adolescent Health Technical Working Group (AHTWG) that completed a needs analysis to identify the most prominent issues affecting adolescent health and development. The needs assessment was followed by a landscape analysis to take stock of existing adolescent programmes, policies, legislation and resources, and to prioritise interventions accordingly. 

 Through national consultations, adolescents identified key issues that affect their health, consolidated into the following four themes by the AH-TWG: 

- Positive health and development 

- violence, accidents and injury 

- Sexual and reproductive health

Under each theme, adolescents (in consultation with key stakeholders) identified priority programmes and services. The Adolescent Health national Strategic Plan will be implemented in three phases over a period of 12 years. The operational plan will be developed every four years, to ensure that implementation strategies remain relevant through each new phase. Three line-ministries will work together to implement the plan, namely the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Ministry of Education, Youth, Sports and Culture (MoEYSC), and the Ministry of Human Development (MHD). These three ministries have the responsibility to translate the policy goals into budget allocations for improving adolescent health^26. 

###### UNICEF’s Work 

Through extensive involvement in the development of the national Adolescent Health Strategy, UnICEf has supported adolescent mental health through a variety of related initiatives: 

**Supporting quality services for adolescents** 

To strengthen health service delivery for adolescents in Belize, the MoH has initiated work to define norms and standards of care for adolescents, including for psychological assessment. In December 2018, the MoH, PAHo, UnICEf and UnfPA reviewed available global guidance on quality standards to develop these norms and standards of the health care plan. The inclusion of psychological assessments in the norms and standards will facilitate timely follow

 up and referrals for improved support for mental health. following the completion of the national adolescent health strategy and adaptation of the norms and standards for adolescent health care in 2019, the MoH will pilot the delivery and evaluate the effectiveness of routine adolescent health check-ups, including psychosocial assessment. UNICEF Belize introduced the Helping Adolescents Thrive (HAT) project, a multi-country initiative to support the development of guidelines on mental health promotion and preventive interventions for adolescents, as well as a package addressing interpersonal violence, mental health, substance abuse, SRH and additional identified local priorities. With support from UnICEf, MoH arranged workshops and training of local facilitators on the concepts and strategies to be used for package, through focus group discussions with adolescents. 

 UNICEF launched U-Report Belize, a platform that enables rapid real-time data collection and information dissemination in support of health literacy. Currently, over 1750 U-Reporters have been registered in Belize (48% males and 52% females). Multiple polls have been conducted and results and basic information have been disseminated through U-Report and WhatsApp. A U-Report poll and a facebook survey enabled wider consultations with adolescents throughout the country. 

 Three rapid online polls collected data via facebook in November 2017. Each poll received between 20 and 28 responses on the priority issues to improve health and wellbeing of adolescents in Belize^27. In July 2018, a U-Report poll collected data on the issues affecting adolescents and the approach that works for adolescents to get engaged. To help bridge

the gap in access to mental health professionals, mental health counselling will be made available country-wide, through U-Report’s U-Partners function. U-Partners operates like a dedicated hotline and enables delivery of scheduled, confidential and quality-assured one-on-one counselling, through trained operators via mobile phone. It also offers an opportunity for earlier facilitated referral to a health facility. 

UnICEf and the Ministries of Health, Education and Human Development, along with PAHo and UnfPA will collaborate to disseminate ageappropriate information on mental health to adolescents to respond to the high rates of anxiety, stress, substance abuse and suicide ideation. The partnership aims to better inform and empower adolescents, providing them with information on adolescent development, coping strategies, and available sources for support. UnICEf has also committed to support the Ministry of Health in exploring options to improve mental health service 

 delivery for adolescents (building mental health literacy, access to counselling, and referral) using digital health tools/U-Report. 

 Evidence generation in adolescent mental health 

 Adolescent mental health is an area of learning for UnICEf, as well as for the government of Belize. To provide baseline information on adolescent mental health in Belize, UNICEF provided technical support to conduct a mapping exercise through an online survey using the “4Ws” tool. The mapping exercise is an important step to enable improved coordination and partnership among government ministries, for improved use of resources across sectors. The survey identified a number of agencies that provide mental health services and support to adolescents, providing the starting-point for establishing implementation guidance for adolescent mental health service delivery. 

 Population-based data on mental health conditions among adolescents can help identify adolescents’ needs and populations at greatest risk and can inform appropriate interventions that address the mental health needs of adolescents. Testing of the Mental Health among Adolescents at the Population Level (MMAP) will be used to measure prevalence and burden of mental ill-health among adolescents (ages 10-19) at the population level, including indicators of anxiety, depression, behavioural problems, functional impairment, and suicide ideation/attempt. 


A Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) study for adolescents in school is planned for 2019, using mental health-related indicators in the Global School Health Survey, together with other standard measurement tools to measure the prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents in school. The KAP study will be conducted through a pilot of MICS plus, as a real-time monitoring of the social norms and cultural attitudes related to mental health. 

In September 2018, UNICEF, PAHO and the Ministry of Health jointly hosted an open House on adolescent health with a focus on mental health. This event was organised as an informal “Town Hall” forum for the exchange of information and ideas and allowed the public to engage with experts in conversations on adolescent mental health. Awareness and understanding of the adolescent mental health 

 issues were increased among partners and stakeholders from the government, NGOs/CSOs, academia and media. 

 In October 2019, together with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Belize government, UNICEF supported a review of findings from a Community Gang Assessment. The assessment provides information on the extent and level of gang activity in Belize City, its impact on all sectors of the community, and risk factors specific to adolescents and young people’s involvement in gangs. As a proactive preventive measure and to facilitate early intervention, risk assessment for gang involvement will be included in the standard assessment for adolescent clients seen in health facilities in gang affected communities. 


## LEBANON

More than eight years into the Syrian conflict, the Middle East and north Africa (MEnA) Region is the most dangerous region in the world for adolescents today^28. Over 70% of adolescents who died due to collective violence globally were living in MEnA. Lebanon accommodates more than 1.5 million displaced Syrians, the highest per capita number of refugees in the world. one in six people living in Lebanon is between the ages of 15 and 24, of which more than half a million are considered vulnerable, including 164,000 Syrian and 51,000 Palestinian youth. A 2012 study of adolescents in South Lebanon found 18.2% had experienced at least one highmagnitude, war-related traumatic event^29. Among lebanese youth, mental health issues are the leading cause of Years lost to Disability (YlDs). Results from the 2017 Global School-based Student Health Survey showed that 14% of 13-17 year-olds had considered suicide, while 10% had attempted suicide in the preceding 12 months 30. 

 Conflict in the region have significantly impacted the country’s economy and infrastructure, placing strain on existing public services. Due to the Syrian refugee crisis, many children and adolescents have been exposed to violence, including sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). An estimated 180,000 children are engaged in child labour, including in its worst forms. Early marriage is especially pronounced in Palestinian camps and among Syrian refugees. An alarmingly high number (94%) of nonlebanese youth are not enrolled in formal education, and participation in informal learning is equally low. For both refugees and Lebanese citizens, there exists a critical need for increased mental health support, as well as attention to child protection.

created a national mental health programme (nMHP) to reform the mental health system in lebanon^31. lebanon’s national mental health programme, established in 2014, shifted the service provision from privatised and unregulated, to a system of comprehensive, coordinated services. A Mental Health and Psycho-Social Support (MHPSS) task force was established to mainstream an MHPSS approach in all sectors (education, protection, water sanitation and hygiene). The programme emphasises community involvement, a continuum of care, human rights, and cultural relevance in mental health services 32. The services are multi-layered and integrated into the relevant government ministries. Adolescent life skills development, for example, is coordinated with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, while mental health and psychosocial support services are coordinated within the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA). 

**Mental health promotion through life-skills education** 

Since 2017, UNICEF reached over 50,000 adolescents and youth with integrated and structured life skills, sport for development and positive leadership programmes^33. Their life skills programme is implemented by several partners across the country, reaching vulnerable adolescents and youth with essential life skills education related to positive communication and effective team work. The programme consists of a core life skills package, to which implementing partners can add additional components, based on the specific needs of youth in their community. for example, in areas where youth struggle to accept and socialise with youth who are 

 “different”, content that encourages social cohesion and breaking down barriers can be added to the core package. In areas where substance abuse is prominent, the life skills programme includes education and awareness around substance use, health campaigning and community events^34. 

 Through the Life Skills and Citizenship Education (lSCE) curriculum, UnICEf conducted a Trainer of Trainer (ToT) for two new modules for young people in lebanon around social cohesion and employability. A total of 40 trainers (75% female; 25% male) from the Lebanese MOSA and NGO partners were certified and joined over 90 trainers previously certified in the positive leadership module last year^35. 

 Line Up Live Up (LULU): An evidence-informed life skills education programme The LULU programme targets at-risk youth (14-18 years) who live in adverse circumstances. Using sport activities, the programme aims to build life skills and increase resilience to risky behaviour, including harmful substance use. During the sessions, participants play sports and focus on skills such as decision-making, saying no and critical thinking, which is then linked to real-life situations, including drug use. In collaboration with the national Mental Health Programme, the Ministry of Public Health, UnoDC and Soins Informiers et Developpement Communautaire (SIDC), UnICEf supported a training for trainers on the lUlU programme, which was successfully piloted and now being rolled out to all 8 governorates.

**Creating awareness and providing support for issues related to gender-based violence (GBV)** 

UnICEf lebanon partnered with a local nGo (KAfA) to address Gbv and discrimination. Communitybased training sessions are delivered to adolescents (12-18 years old), using learning through peer-group role play, while engaging and including adolescents from the community to participate and assist in delivering sessions on Gbv. Psychosocial support sessions are also provided, to improve awareness, knowledge and resilience among adolescents. Over 130,000 individuals were sensitised on GBV through awareness sessions and community group engagement. UnICEf and partners have also supported over 60,000 women and girls to access safe spaces that offer information sessions and ageappropriate psychosocial services. for survivors of Gbv, case management is available, as well as referral to specialised services. 

**Community-based psychosocial support** 

**Social development centres** Through the development of social development centres (SDCs), UnICEf and partners provided support to MoSA in developing its national Plan to Safeguard Women and Children. These communitybased government institutions provide an accessible platform to provide a range of social services to children and families. Through technical, financial and human resource assistance, UnICEf supports 81 SDCs in the 251 localities representing the majority of refugees and vulnerable lebanese communities. The SDCs offer multi-layer services and referrals in collaboration with 16 UNICEF partners. In 2016-2017, SDCs were supported 

 to facilitate and lead the establishment of family Support networks to help regulate services provided by civil society actors at the local level and to ensure access for vulnerable children and women 36. 

 Services for refugee communities In 2017, UNICEF provided essential services to Palestinian refugee camps, including immunisations and medication, health, nutrition, water and sanitation services, as well as learning materials and activities. Over 45,000 children and adolescents received psychosocial support. To mitigate negative financial coping strategies among refugee families (e.g. child labour, child marriage, school nonattendance, eating less), a humanitarian child well-being grant was piloted in two governorates. The grant assists families financially and assists with the indirect costs of children attending school. Monitored through an outcome evaluation by Innocenti, the pilot showed higher school enrolment and attendance rates and less reliance on negative coping strategies. 

 Child friendly spaces UnICEf provides psychosocial support to Syrian refugee children in lebanon within the context of its Child Protection and Education emergency response. The Child friendly Spaces provide a safe place for Syrian children to re-establish routines, to play, study, express their feelings, and spend time with peers, as well as integrate with their lebanese peers. for children who have developed symptoms of distress, social workers provide support, under the guidance of a trained psychologist. In lebanon, UNICEF supports a network of 16 child friendly spaces where children from refugee and local communities have access to a range of services, 

36 UNICEF 2018. Operational guidelines on community based mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian settings: Three-tiered support for children and families (field test version). 


such as structured recreational opportunities, play groups, peer support services and remedial classes. These spaces also serve as an entry point to work with parents and communities on issues concerning children and adolescents, and identifying those in need of further protection and support. 

**Coordinated efforts have been instrumental to Lebanon’s success:** Through improved coordination, UnICEf and partners have supported standardisation and quality in community-based mental health and psycho-social support (MHPSS) and child protection approaches in lebanon. Three coordination forums 

 have been established, where information related to service gaps and needs can easily be shared. The forums have allowed for the development of common approaches and tools, which has helped to ensure that service provision is standardised and consistent. Standardised tools, curricula and operating procedures have been developed for psychosocial support activities, to ensure that they are inclusive and implemented with respect to age, gender and diversity considerations. Through these efforts, children and adolescents have received increasing mental health support and access to services. 


## NEPAL 

 InTEGRATIon of MEnTAl HEAlTH InTo ADolESCEnT fRIEnDlY SERvICES 

With 40% of Nepal’s population under the age of 18 years, addressing the mental health needs of children and adolescents will be crucial to the country’s future development. Children are overrepresented among the poor, with 31% of children under the age of 18 years living in poverty^37. Nepal is highly prone to natural hazards, such as earthquakes, which lead to displacements, disappearances, injuries and death. These events have severe implications for families and children, and their mental well-being 38. In the span of less than one month, two devastating earthquakes resulted in over 8,000 deaths, 450,000 people displaced and over 8.5 million people affected 39. Despite this, child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) problems have received little attention in nepal 40. While the magnitude of child and adolescent mental problems in nepal is still undetermined, the Ministry of Health and Population of Nepal estimates that about 15– 20% of this population (2–3 million) may suffer from some form of mental disorder^41. 

Among the country’s youth, suicide is a significant problem in Nepal, where 340,000 adolescents attempt suicide every year^42. Research with families 

 of suicide victims reported that they attributed their children’s suicides to issues such as interpersonal fights, feelings of failure in life or being overwhelmed by poverty 43. 

 Child marriage is another prominent issue, with more than one-third of women aged 20 to 24 years having married before the age of 18 years, and 16% of these women having had a child before the age of 18 years. For children aged 10-14 years, 38% are employed, with working children more likely to be out of school. Although nepal’s government has mandated free and compulsory education up to grade 8, a substantial number of children, especially girls, are still out of school. More than 30% of primary and lower secondary school age children are out of school^44. Within the education setting, marginalised children and children from certain castes face exclusion and bullying. 

 Due to a well-developed emergency response following the earthquakes, there is strong capacity for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) among nGo and other partners. Government mental health services on the other hand, are limited to a

few hospitals in larger cities, and lack specialised support services for children and adolescents. Until recently, the focus has largely been on adult mental health, and support for CAMH has been missing^45. 

###### UNICEF’s Work 

The government of nepal has recently started to prioritise adolescent mental health, with CAMH included as a priority in the country’s latest mental health policy. UnICEf is supporting their Ministry of Health (MoH) to develop a CAMH training package for health workers and doctors. The package is being tested in one municipality and one hospital, with the aim to roll out a refined model more widely in the coming years^46. UnICEf also supports the implementation of life skills programmes, community-based mental health and psychosocial support, and youth engagement and consultation to promote and support adolescent health and wellbeing. 

**Life skills programmes** 

nepal’s mental health policy emphasises the importance of promoting mental health awareness through community structures such as schools, and building appropriate mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in education settings to reach children. Psychosocial programmes have been implemented in formal and informal education, including through recreational activities and the implementation of a classroom-based intervention. This 15-session intervention combines elements of creative expressive therapy, cooperative play and cognitive behavioural techniques. These initiatives 

 are part of a multi-tiered psychosocial and mental health care package for children affected by armed conflict. Psychosocial support is also included in the teachers’ curriculum supported by the Ministry of Education^47. 

 UnICEf supports the GATE (Girls’ Access to Education) Programme, which provides literacy and numeracy education, along with life skills training, for out of school adolescent girls. The programme aims to equip girls with the skills needed to go back to school and to raise awareness among their families. Girls in the programme also receive information on issues related to reproductive health, domestic violence and child marriage. “Rupantaran” (transformation in English) is a training skills programme for adolescents in social, civic and financial knowledge and skills. In 2017, 12,993 adolescents (67% girls, 33% boys) received training in the “Rupantaran” programme to influence decisions that affect them and to become change agents in their communities. UnICEf will continue to support the government in including the life-skills modules from “Rupantaran” within the formal and non-formal curricula. Another intervention for adolescents called “SangSangai” equipped 21,466 adolescents (54% females, 46% males) with knowledge and skills on topics related to adolescent sexual and reproductive health and financial literacy. 

 Mental health and psychosocial support as part of the earthquake response: 

 Six months following the earthquakes in nepal, the Department of Women and Children and UnICEf co-led an active psychosocial working group of 80 organisations providing early response activities.

Operational guidelines on community based mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian settings: Three-tiered support for children and families (field test version). 


UnICEf supported key nGos to implement a range of interventions integrated with the protection, education and health sectors and developed a template to track services implemented by partners working in MHPSS. Within one year after the earthquake, more than 380,000 people had received MHPSS care and support. The MHPSS initiatives include: 

- Community psychosocial centres within women’s     cooperatives to improve access for rural     communities to psychosocial care and support     and referral to mental health services. 

- Psychosocial programmes in formal and     informal educational settings, including through     recreational activities and implementation of the     15-session classroom-based Intervention. 

- Community MHPSS messaging through     community orientation and training sessions. 

Community messaging and mobilisation are very effective in nepal because the informal sector is a major source of support for children and families. Throughout the country are active child protection committees and child clubs, which are supported by the government and nGos. These clubs help to provide access to MHPSS care and referral for vulnerable children and families. 

In addition, disaster risk reduction has been included in the education sector in a three-year project to reduce the vulnerability of children, families and their communities. Eight schools participated in the project, which disseminated knowledge about disaster risk reduction to children, teachers and communities. The programme encouraged the transfer of information from children to parents, as well as encouraging a ‘we can do’ attitude. 

 youth engagement and consultation for adolescent friendly services 

 UnICEf’s Country Programme Action Plan for 2018-2022 aims to address adolescent health issues, including teenage pregnancy, through the implementation of the national Adolescent Health and Development Strategy. The capacity strengthening of health workers will be supported to improve access to gender and adolescent-sensitive health services at health facilities and outreach services, as well as through the school health programme. C4D (Communication for Development) strategies using direct outreach, mass and social media, and e-health platforms seek to promote healthy behaviour by adolescents. UnICEf conducted the formative review of an adolescent health programme, which has addressed the adolescent health situation at global, regional and country level. The review’s focus included adolescent sexual and reproductive health, mental health, nutrition, menstrual hygiene and road traffic injuries^48. 

 Working with the family Health Division under the MoH, UnICEf helped establish a two-way SMS mechanism, so that adolescents can submit their opinions and feedback concerning the availability and quality of health services for adolescents in nepal. Using mobile phone technology through the “Shout out for Health” programme, this initiative aims to involve adolescents in the improvement of delivering adolescent-friendly health services (especially for SRH), to increase access to services and accountability of health service providers for adolescent health. Over 1,500 adolescents throughout the country have registered for the mobile phone programme and shared their

opinions, views and experiences related to health services in their community. Analytics of voices of adolescents are publicly available for real-time viewing at an online dashboard. Key highlights of adolescents’ voices are being compiled in the form of a newsletter and disseminated among health service providers and decision makers. Media will be engaged for spreading the findings back to the adolescents on the response from the stakeholders. Currently responses from the first stream of questions are being analysed. In addition, UnICEf Nepal Country Office worked with Facebook, Nepal Telecommunications Authority and other partners to launch #Net4Good, an online safety campaign for children and adolescents, a day-long education event in Kathmandu aired live on facebook. The lessons learnt will guide the expansion of the campaign in the next Country Programme.

 MEnTAl HEAlTH AnD PSYCHoSoCIAl SUPPoRT AS PART of THE EbolA vIRUS EMERGEnCY RESPonSE 

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), children and adolescents represent more than half (54%) of the population. By the time they enter adolescence, they have often survived devastating effects of conflicts, violence, natural disasters and epidemics. An alarming 80% of children in the DRC are faced with at least two major deprivations of their rights, child labour occurs among more than 40% of children aged 5-14 years, and less than half of children attend secondary school^49. A communitybased study conducted with 1,046 adolescents and young adults (13-21 years) in the war-affected Ituri district found that 95% of adolescents reported exposure to at least one traumatic event and more than half met symptom criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. on average, adolescents were exposed to 4.71 traumatic events, with higher symptoms related to cumulative trauma^50. Routine patient and programme monitoring data from Médecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) showed that 27% of youth attending mental health services presented with a mental health problem associated with armed 

 conflict, of which the most common precipitating event was sexual violence (36.5%) 52. 

 While the mental health impact of the violence and displacement in DRC is considerable, the health system in most areas has limited or no capacity to respond to these needs. Another major challenge relates to outbreaks of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in 2018, the first outbreak of the disease in a conflict setting. Over 500 cases have been reported, resulting in 334 deaths. Children and women have been disproportionately affected 52. 

 Preventing and responding to the Ebola virus disease in the DRC is challenged by factors such as the presence of armed groups and regular displacement of populations. Social factors such as traditional medical practices and cultural norms, and a pre-existing scepticism of government and the Un have further challenged community acceptance of the response.

###### UNICEF’s Work 

**Mental health promotion through life skills education** 

UnICEf supported the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to incorporate learning on ‘life-skills’ into the primary curriculum, through its participation on a technical committee tasked with the curriculum reform. The integrated life skills curriculum aims to build skills such as self-awareness, decision making, interpersonal relationship management, critical thinking, stress management and communication. other topics include prevention of HIv infection, reproductive health and protection against forms of violence. The UNICEF Country Office has additionally set up an adolescent working group, who gather evidence on the situation of adolescents in the country and identify effective packages of multi-sector interventions that can be delivered in the next Country Programme^53. 

**Child protection** 

From 2013 to July 2018, the Government, with the support of UNICEF, trained a total of 12,800 children on their rights, including 830 Youth Reporters. In 2018, engagement of the Youth Reporters resulted in the adoption of 50 commitments by national, provincial, and local authorities, including the signing of a decree on the establishment of a children’s parliament 54. UnICEf’s “Young Reporters” actively contribute to media coverage of child issues in the DRC, to help create an environment that is favourable to the rights of the child. In support of ending child marriage, UnICEf contributed to the 

 establishment of a revised family Code and the 2017-2026 action plan, adopted by the government. A mandatory module on children’s rights were also included in the curricula of law faculties across the country, improving the normative and protection framework for children in the DRC^55. 

 Integrating child protection and mental health and psychosocial support into the Ebola response 

 Going beyond traditional psychosocial programmes, UnICEf and its partners, including the Ministry of Heath, have adopted an innovative approach where the Child Protection (CP) and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) response formed a core part of the Ebola virus disease response. The Ministry of Health, WHo, UnICEf and partners are jointly responding to the 10th Ebola virus outbreak in north Kivu Province. The response is set up through different commissions: Surveillance, vaccination, Infection Prevention Control (IPC)-WASH, Treatment, Psychosocial, Communication, Security and logistics. The UnICEf Child Protection team in the DRC coleads the psycho-social pillar of the Ebola response with the Ministry of Health, while the main partner of implementation is the Danish Refugee Council (DRC). The Danish Refugee Council has had a strong presence in the area for decades, which has been a positive determinant in the quality of intervention delivery. 

 As a matter of great urgency, the Psychosocial Commission was successfully set up in all the sites affected by EvD. The commission includes psychologists, psychosocial agents and Ebola survivors (all Congolese) as well as UnICEf and DRC team staffs (international and national). To

date, there is a total of 288 psychologists and psychosocial workers. The psychosocial workers were all recruited locally, in each of the EvD affected health zones. Local recruitment helps guarantee that response workers are well accepted in the communities, since they are aware of specific social aspects and cultural norms and they are consequently able to provide psychosocial support which is specifically relevant to the needs of affected populations^56. 

Psychosocial support is comprised of daily individualised household visits to break stigmatisation and identify any social problems which may result following the case of Ebola. Psychosocial workers also ensure that children and families with more severe psychological or social problems have access to professional help. The strategy further includes psychosocial training for social workers on referral, follow up and provision of psychosocial support and alternative care. 

Through this initiative, UnICEf has reached over 4,700 contact families with psychosocial and material assistance, provided psychosocial and nutritional care to 421 infected children admitted to Ebola treatment centres and over 400 orphans and separated children^57. In addition, UnICEf created a dashboard reporting on the MHPSS activities for the Ebola response. 

 The work of UnICEf DRC highlighted here provides a valuable example of ways to inform and adapt child protection programming during public health emergencies, and how to build a more integrated approach between various response initiatives. furthermore, the psychosocial approaches adopted for this Ebola response could also be explored for psychosocial activities in UnICEf Child Protection regular programmes, particularly in regard to children associated with armed groups and the reintegration issue. 

 UNICEF’s child protection and psychosocial support for EVD survivors and family members: 

- Integration of MHPSS in the different     components of the response 

- Provides psychosocial support to EvD affected     and contact persons 

- Provides material assistance to affected     families 

- Individualized and case by case approach     adopted, where psychosocial support is more     individualized, and the material assistance is     defined according to the needs of families and     children affected by EvD. 

- Identifies and provides appropriate care to     orphans and children separated from their     parents due to the epidemic 

- Works with specialized staff to help children     and families with more severe psychological or     social problems / needs; especially for Ebola     survivors

## TAJIKISTAN 

 INTEGRATING MENTAL HEALTH IN THE YOUTH SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT COUNTRY PROGRAM 

###### Background 

###### Program 

 In 2016, the government issued and approved the national Adolescents Development and Participation programme with a focus on mental health. UNICEF Tajikistan has a programme with exactly same name within its current CPD for 20162020 where one of three outputs is about establishing youthfriendly health services in the country. The MoES and MoH had a join order on the implementation of this program and established two working groups: decision making and technical experts. The Ministry of Education and 

In 2010, UNICEF received an ocial request from the governor of the Sughd province in Tajikistan to help the province identify causes of high suicide rates among adolescents. In 2011, UNICEF supported the Study on the prevalence and dynamics of suicide among 12-24 year olds in that region in partnership with Columbia University and Tajik National University. Throughout the study, they were supported by a local working group established under the Child Rights Unit, an institution responsible for safeguarding child rights at local level. In conjunction with the study, Khujand State University and a network of NGOs were mobilized to provide free psychosocial support to each of the respondents in the study. The demand for this service was high, highlighting the unmet need for mental health and psychosocial support among adolescents in Tajikistan. The findings from this study stated an average yearly suicide rate of 11.2 (per 100,000) young persons aged 12-24 from 2009-2010, for young girls the rate was 11.7 (per 100,000) and for young 

 boys the rate was 10.6 (per 100,000). This study was then presented to the Ministry of Education and Sciences and the Ministry of Health and advocated at the government level. 

- 1 in 3 adolescents (10-19 yrs) reports being depressed 

- 1% of health budget is allocated to mental health     in the country (2018) 

- 1.3% of adolescents benefit from youth-friendly     health services, though this service is underutilized

Sciences is the coordinating body for the program that is implemented in close collaboration with Ministries of Health, Interior, Committee on Youth Affairs and Commission of Child Rights in 9 districts – 220 schools. 

In 2017, implementation of the program began in select districts throughout the country based on the results from the study in 2011. The program covered 220 school and focused on prevention of mental health conditions using schools as an entry point due to high attendance rates until grade 9. The program also established a referral pathway to connect schools to primary health care facilities. Other sectors such as the police, prosecutor’s oce and the child rights unit were involved with the goal of sensitizing them on adolescent health and development as well as child-friendly approaches of investigation of cases of juvenile delinquency, suicide and violence against adolescents and youth.. A delegation from Tajikistan, composed of representatives from MoE, MoH, presidential administration, and national association of psychologists visited Germany to understand how mental health programs were established and running. The CO supported training of a pool of national trainers in Tajikistan and then those trainers trained more than 600 school psychologists, family doctors, school administrations, and law enforcement staff to create a favorable environment in schools for this mental health and psychosocial support service. Relevant regulations and guidelines had been developed: a package of training modules on psychosocial development of children and adolescents; screening instruments to detect depression and autoaggression among adolescents; Standard Operational Procedures for the Referral Pathway; Terms of Reference for school psychologists; monitoring and evaluation framework. After the 

 capacity building stage, the programme moved to the stage of service delivery (e.g. delivery of counseling services by psychologists and counselors in schools and referral of cases to PHC and other relevant institutions). Monitoring of progress showed that 16% of adolescents in all target schools received mental health counseling and only 0.8% of them were referred to other services by school specialists, this indicates that it is feasible for the preventive approach to start from school. The program also goes beyond just suicide and captures broader issues of mental health among adolescents. 

 In November 2019, the national workshop had been conducted to present this program pilot: all governmental sectors agreed on the success of this program and authorized expansion of this program to 200 more schools. 

 AMH Referral Pathway 

###### Challenges/lessons learned 

- Persistence of clinical approaches in the     national health system and lack of effort on     the prevention angle 


- Poor cross-sectoral collaboration 

- Poor understanding of the issue among     parents 

- Limited access of professionals to relevant     resources that can help their work in AMH     support (printed, electronic, web sites, social     media groups) 

###### Current efforts 

In addition to the counseling team in schools and creating capacity of referral points, the program has established a peer-peer system in 50 of the schools. The 209 trained adolescents (4 per school, 2 girls and 2 boys) had been engaged in identifying early signs of emotional distresses in their peers and provision of support and motivation to their peers in seeking help from psychologists. They also make referrals and accompany peers at psychologist appointments in order to help curb the stigma associated with these appointments. The program consists of several mini sessions for the peer-peer program training among students aged 11-17 yrs. 

###### Next steps 

- Institutionalization of AMH topic within pre-and-in     service: incorporating adolescent mental health     into curricula in in-service institutions of     education and health sector as well as in relevant     University programmes in order to train the next     generation of MHPSS providers. Tajik National     University already introduced one course on     mental health and prevention of suicide among     adolescents 

- Development/ finalization of relevant regulations /     protocols/ manuals/ screening tests as supporting     tools for school psychologists 

- Refine and approve standard operating procedures     for the referral pathway so that when there is a     mental health case or suicide attempt there are     guidelines for each agency to follow on how to 

 refer and provide support to adolescents and their families 

- Analyze the existing infrastructure for     rehabilitation of victims of psychological     violence (with MoHSP, local government-support     centers, and Committee of Women). 

- Expand program to other regions of the country,     including Khatlon and GBAO provinces 

- Explore the out-of-school model of this system of     provision of mental health services using the     infrastructure of Centers for Additional Education     in seven districts of the country in the scope of     UNICEF and WB Gen U partnership launched     this year. 

- Youth Friendly Health Service departments     are functioning in 21 clinics 

- Peer-to-peer HIV prevention implemented     through awareness raising on Reproductive     Health and Rights 

- Capacity of 669 professionals built 

- 209 girls and boys prepared to provide support     to their peers in 50 schools in pilot regions 

- 10932 adolescents with increased awareness     on signs of emotional distress and coping skills 

- 445 adolescents referred by peer supporters     to school psychologist for provision of     professional support 

- 839 community members with increased     awareness on adolescent mental health and     existing systems of support 

- 180 specialists from education, health, social     protection, law enforcement, youth and family     affairs involved in process evaluation

## MONGOLIA 

 MonGolIA’S CRoSS-SECToRAl AnD MUlTI-lEvEl RESPonSE To IMPRovInG ADolESCEnT MEnTAl HEAlTH 

###### Background 

Mongolia has among the highest rates of adolescent suicide in East Asia and the Pacific – approximately five times the regional average. Recent research found approximately 50% of college students report suicidal ideation and more than 14% report clinically significant symptoms of depression. Another study stated that 1 in 3 adolescents suffer from emotional or behavioral problems and 1 in 10 suffer from psychosocial disorders. These mental health issues vary considerably with gender. Adolescent boys commit suicide at a rate 3 times that of adolescent girls the same age (22 boys per 100,000 compared to 7 girls per 100,000). However, girls are more likely to report seriously considering suicide (28% of girls versus 17% of boys) and are also more likely to report suicide attempts. Mental health disorders are more common among boys, particularly, behavioral issues such as conduct disorder, hyperactivity, and attention deficit disorder. In contrast, social and emotional problems such as anxiety and depression are more common among 

 girls. There is also reported to be a higher risk for suicidal plans and behaviors among adolescents living in urban centers and those who feel lonely or worried, smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or have fights at school. Other risk factors for mental health problems and suicide risk include poverty, social exclusion, violence, peer rejection, isolation, lack of family support, and pressure to achieve. In addition, emerging issues, such as online bullying, grooming, sexual abuse, gaming related disorders, and drug use are increasingly impacting the mental health and well-being of young people. 

###### Actions 

 As a response to these alarmingly high suicide rates, UnICEf supported the Mongolian Government in a cross-sectoral and multi-level response to improving adolescent mental health. This response consisted of influencing policy and programs, evidence generation, improving service delivery systems, empowering adolescents, and making mental health programming gender responsive. 

 KEy CHALLENGES: 

- High suicide rate,     increasing substance use,     bullying, etc... 

- very few mental health     services and resources     dedicated to adolescents 

- Poor understanding     among parents, teachers,     and communities 

 RESPONSES: 

- Development of adolescent mental     health workplan 

- baseline survey on status of     adolescent mental health 

- Development of mental health support     teams in schools 

- further support for health education     in schools including development of     educational materials and teacher     trainings to specifically improve the     quality of mental health classes

**Policy & programs** 

- Support for national programs on child and     adolescent development and protection     including nCDs and mental health priorities. 

- Strategies to strengthen health,     education, and social protection to provide     adolescent mental health services. 

- Support for Mongolia’s first national     conference on adolescent mental health,     which brings together experts and     stakeholders from across sectors. 

- Development of an adolescent mental     health work plan, approved by both     the Ministry of Health and Ministry of     Education, Culture, Science and Sports. 

- Awareness raising with government     decision-makers and the public for the     prevalence and burden of mental health     problems among adolescents. 

**Evidence generation**

- national survey of adolescent’s life     skills: Strengths and Supports in     the lives of Mongolian Youth. 

- Improving service delivery systems: 

- Health: strengthening existing adolescent     friendly health service delivery systems by     building capacity of doctors in adolescent mental     health including psychological counselling. 

- Education: introduction of mental     health counselling in schools and target     areas. Development and integration of a     counselling module in teacher training     and capacity building with school doctors,     social workers and teachers. 

 Empower adolescents 

- Establishment of health education in the     secondary school curriculum including     modules on mental health, nutrition,     comprehensive sexuality education (CSE)     and gender-based violence (Gbv). 

- Design and implementation of a life skills     program, which supports socio-emotional     learning, adolescent empowerment, and     communication with families, peers and teachers. 

- Establishment of child development     centers in target schools to support     adolescent development and participation     through student-led publications, clubs,     student councils, and peer education. 

 Gender response 

- Raising awareness of social norms that     impact adolescent mental health including     gender barriers to mental health promotion. 

- Incorporating gender equality and bias,     gender norms, stereotypes, and power in     relationships to CSE and Gbv curricula. 

- A life skills program is being reviewed     in consultation with adolescents to     make it gender-responsive. 

###### Challenges/Lessons learned 

 There are very limited mental health services dedicated to children and adolescents in Mongolia. There is only one department in the entire country with 25 inpatient beds, 3 doctors, 6 nurses, and 1 social worker. Mental health disorders are also highly stigmatized in Mongolian society and only few parents seek counselling or medical help when their children have psychological concerns. 


###### Next steps 

- Support for strengthening M&E systems     for adolescent mental health including     a qualitative survey to explore gender     barriers to adolescent mental health. 

- Continued improvement of adolescent health     services including development of a post     graduate adolescent health training program     with mental health modules for clinicians. 

- Development of mental health support teams     in schools composed of school managers,     doctors, social workers, health teachers,     etc... who are trained to assist teachers     identify students in need, provide primary     level counselling, instigate referral to     secondary mental health services, and provide     immediate support to suicidal adolescents. 

- further support for health education in     schools including development of educational     materials and teacher trainings to specifically     improve the quality of mental health classes. 

- Peer education on mental health and     investment in innovative approaches     to reach adolescents in need. 

- Parent education implemented through school’s     parent nights and development of parent toolkits. 

- Development of a list of required adolescent     mental health services in all relevant sectors     with costing of services and advocacy for     budget allocation.In 2017, implementation of the     program began in select districts throughout     the country based on the results from the     study in 2011.
